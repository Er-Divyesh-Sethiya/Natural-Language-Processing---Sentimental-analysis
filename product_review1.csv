This is the second time I am writing this review. Not sure why my earlier detailed review which was more like a ownership review was deleted by Amazon. Hope this review is published and not eventually deleted however this review would not be as detailed as the previous one. Purchased this product in Aug 2020 and since then had 3 replacements from Boat within a year. Each unit would last 3 to 4 months max depending upon the usage and always one or the other earpiece would die out. The left earpiece of the 3rd replacement died out 2 days back. Please note I have mostly used them during my morning jogging/running. Over all the sound quality is good and enjoy them as long as they last but the overall durability of the device is very very poor. Attaching the 3 earpiece chargers as a proof.,This is the second time I am writing this review. Not sure why my earlier detailed review which was more like a ownership review was deleted by Amazon.

"1. Quite good look2. Better noise cancellation, good base.3. Quite lighter, fixes in the ear well4. Inspite having bluetooth 5.0, Doesn't connect to two Device at same time. I had bought it to use it with my honor smart watch along with my mobile but couldn't do so.5. No charging cable, No ear buds of different size, Nothing extraa given.Can't comment on battery backup. Seemed good.","1. Quite good look2. Better noise cancellation, good base.3. Quite lighter, fixes in the ear well4. Inspite having bluetooth 5.0, Doesn't connect to two Device at same time.

"its a good set of ear buds but1. the quality of sound gets bad when connected with macbook2. due to absence of dual mic noise cancellation, it becomes very difficult to use it during a call as the other person hears lot of envt. noiseinability to use it during the call is the one big major disadvantage for this pair but other features are good like instant connection with mobile etc","its a good set of ear buds but1. the quality of sound gets bad when connected with macbook2. due to absence of dual mic noise cancellation, it becomes very difficult to use it during a call as the other person hears lot of envt. noiseinability to use it during the call is the one big major disadvantage for this pair but other features are good like instant connection with mobile etc",good set ear bud quality sound get bad connect macbook due absence dual mic noise cancellation become difficult use call person hear lot envt noiseinability use call one big major disadvantage pair feature good like instant connection mobile etc
"I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.My priorities were like this -1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.(I'm an audiophile but was ready to compromise cuz budget :P)2. Type C Charging - I use a Oneplus 6T so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. Shoudn't feel bulky in the ears.And then I got these buds, and here goes my feedback -1. First Impression - They look great, love the red and black color tone.2. Fits well in the ears without feeling bulky.3. Not super satisfied with the audio quality, felt it was too Bass heavy(Found a fix with Equaliser settings).4. There's no volume control option from the buds, but you can do it from your phone without much effort(Ain't it?).Fix to adjust bass if you're on a Oneplus Device -1. Fortunately Oneplus provides Audio Tuner to adjust EQ at OS level.2. Open the Audio Tuner and go to Sound Enhancement.3. Select Feat. JBL E1+4. Open Preset options5. Select Blues and Voila!! 🎯For other phones -I'm not sure about other devices as I haven't tested on them, but here are a couple of things I used to do on my previous phones to adjust sound settings. As most phones or music player apps provide equaliser settings, you can select presets like 'Vocal/Jazz/Blues/Pop' which tend to compress Bass and enhance Mids and Treble.Also, after reading a couple of reviews of other TWS buds, I considered changing the ear tips to smaller ones and surprisingly it boosted the experience. However, it mostly depends on the size of your ears so might not work for everyone.Do let me know if you need any further information about this, happy to help! 🙂Happy Listening! 🎶","I have been researching about getting a nice TWS buds for my everyday use.My priorities were like this -1.

"Boat AirDopes, have by far been the most champion looking TWS that I have invested in. However, it makes me feel that the premium looks are simply to deceive the customers from other core issues that thus TWS has.1. Connectivity: The connectivity is very poor and there is a lag between the video and audio.2. Battery: The right earphones, just don't charge. So, I have been using just one TWS since about 2-3 months.3. Warranty: There is no warranty on the product, and team boat never ever replies. It's absolutely impossible to get in touch with them. They are almost invisible. The aftersale services have been the worst. Actually, non existent.4. Amazon: This is the 4th review that I am writing. Amazon has been consistently deleting my reviews.","Boat AirDopes, have by far been the most champion looking TWS that I have invested in.

"Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself. They are just buying Chinese products and selling it by their name.I have extensively used these buds for a month while doing workout and watching movies and listening music and below is my detailed review of the Earbuds.Pros:1. Great Sound Quality2. Great Bass3. Great Battery Life4. Fast ChargingCons:1. It doesn't fit properly in ears. It is just not me, 3 more friends of mine are facing the same issue. It doesn't fit properly specially in the right ear. Also, your right ear starts paining after sometime if you push it or try to fit it properly by rotating it in your ear.2. So, if the right bud doesn't fit properly so obviously you don't feel good sound quality from your right ear bud. Sometimes I felt that their is some problem with the Right earbud sound quality but then I realised that it is because of the fitting issue.3. Earbuds slips out of your ear when you wear it while working out due to sweat. It gets slipped when it gets wet due to sweat. Even when the earbuds are fitted properly they will fall out when they get wet.4. The company says that as soon as you open the charging box of the buds both buds gets paired between each other automatically but sometimes both doesn't gets paired between each other and only left or the right one gets paired to the phone or the laptop. Then you have to wait for sometime for the other to get paired.5. The range of the Bluetooth is not that great. Sometimes even you are in the range or at the boundary level within the range one of the buds will stop working and you will hear sound from only one bud. Most of the times it is Right.6. Sometimes one of the earbud stops working without any reason and the battery status of both the buds are different which is very weird.7. My right Earbud stopped working after a month. So I have to find a Service Centre which are not everywhere and not very good.8. Last but certainly not the least, their after sales service is horrible. Their customer care doesn't respond to calls, emails, Twitter or anything. It is a pain to reach out to them. They behave like a roadside local shop.So all in all it is a good pair of earbuds but Rs.2500/- is too much for these earbuds. So I would not suggest to buy this pair of Earbuds at this price.You can buy Noise Shots or Noise Shots XO and those are much better and you will enjoy the experience with them.boAt is Horrible and ridiculous.","Boat is an Indian Company but all the products of this company are Made in China so it is not making the products itself.

"The sound quality is really really good.And the buds looked very beautiful and attractive.Specially if you love red colour.The green-blue flickering lights made it more attractive. Voice quality on calls is not good. You have to speak a little louder than normal which is not feasible at most times. And there is a lot of noise on and off calls. Because of noise during calls, i had to disconnect the call in-between and talk through my phone. This is not why bought this wireless earbud. And after using it for nearly an hour, there is pain in my ears.","The sound quality is really really good.And the buds looked very beautiful and attractive.Specially if you love red colour.The green-blue flickering lights made it more attractive.

"I received Boat Airdopes 441 from Amazon on Friday 19th June..But there's an issue. I hear a strange noise from left earbud every time I play something. Be it from YouTube or be it from a music app. Its 'hiss' kind of sound. It is only heard when I press play button and continues throughout the video/audio and when I stop it, the noise goes off. This particular noise is also heard when I get notification on phone. It is clearly noticed when there is silence in room. I googled and its called static noise something. I am worried now. Anyone else is experiencing this noise? How do I get rid of this sound? Its really annoying. Not finding solution on the internet. Please help me.I think I got a faulty piece. I will contact Boat customer care on Monday and return on Amazon. I want replacement with a goid, proper product.EDIT: I ordered replacement and received this morning. The new airdopes also have the 'hiss' noise. I think it is in all the airdopes. Dear boAt, you have made the amazing design for the Airdopes 441.  Also, the sound quality is best.

"* It's my first ever truly wireless buds and the sound quality is very good. Bass quality is awesome.* Earbuds are really light in weight and easy to fit due to its ergonomic design and never falls off the ears.Though the case is bit on the heavier side but it's totally understandable as it carries 2600mAh battery.Rgb lighting and touch is very responsive* The instant wake n pair tech is really good within 2 secs of opening the case buds gets connected to the previously paired device.* I tried playing pubg and I didn't notice any latency , it was really fine.* While calling indoors the voice reaching is clear and crisp but as it has no noise cancellation for mic in outdoor condition or noisy environment will not be that good but still I'll say above avg performance.**** Battery🔋 review (after 2 weeks)Battery life is exactly what they have promised and I guess I got even more than that.I charged the case as soon as I got it and then didn't charge it for around 12 days and it's still working and on everyday basis I used the buds for 4-5 times .I used it for 5 hours continuously with 2-3 hrs of gaming and video streaming and still 30% was left.And if you use the buds at 55-60%(which I guess is the best because it's very loud) volume it will surely last for 6-6½ hrs.Buds gets charged very quickly I guess within 20-25 mins of putting them back into the case.The case takes around 1hr 15 mins or so to get fully charged.****** ONE THING I'LL LIKE TO ADD IS, I USED IT WITH MY MACBOOK AND I NOTICED THE VOLUME WAS EXTREMELY LOW BUT ON THE OTHER HAND IF USED WITH ANY MOBILE, IT'S VOLUME IS REALLY HIGH. SO I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S MACBOOK'S PROBLEM OR EARBUDS'S, BUT I DON'T MIND AND IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING BUYING THIS FOR USING WITH LAPTOPS I WOULD SUGGEST YOU TO CHECK THIS ISSUE WITH SOMEONE ELSE BUT IF YOU'RE GETTING FOR USING IT WITH PHONES THEN JUST GO FOR IT.","* It's my first ever truly wireless buds and the sound quality is very good.

"From the first look, they really looked very nice. I bought the red colour, and the red colour pops-up really nice.They Charging Case is also very nice looking.I wore them for a few minutes, and my ears started hurting.The fitting is going to be different for each user, depending on the size of their years and their comfort.Music lovers may not appreciate this, as it does not have enough bass.For people who would like to use it for official or personal calls, will feel that you will Sound robotic to the other person.There is also a delay in voice-over, which I think it’s not that bad.The noise cancellation is not there at all.These are much better than a few of similar products available in the market. However, it will be to each user to choose these based on their comfort level as well as their pocket.","From the first look, they really looked very nice.

"If you are a fan of bass like I am, hell, you are gonna love these airdopes. I have been using Boat products for a while and haven't gone unsatisfied even if I feel the durability of said products could have been more. Sometimes, one earbuds stop to work. Happened many times. I had a boat 225 and then a Boat 255 Pro. But they had got one thing in common -- BASS. I'm a basshead and Boat products are a sure shot recommend.Of late, I had been researching a lot of true wireless earbuds. I checked out several including Redmi Earbuds S, MI TWS Earbuds, Blaupunkt BTW-01, Realme Earbuds X TWS, and a few others. I settled, however, on Boat 441 Airdopes as I have built this trust factor with Boat products and am very skeptical of going to any other, especially Boat really offers their audio equipments at an affordable price. I watched a lot of reviews for these Airdopes and settled on it finally. I am usually a paranoid person, but I am glad to say that I am satisfied at the moment with what I have purchased.This is a 3-day usage review. I will edit this review as I pass the 1-month,  3-month and 6-month marks. On the basis of my usage, I will let you know why I recommend it.Let me talk about the Amazon delivery first. Contactless and on time delivery even in these pandemic times. So, salute to the delivery heroes who are functioning even in these risky and dangerous times. Salute boss!The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement foldable pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.The earbuds were at 80% charge when it arrived, but I had it charged full as soon as I opened the case. At 100% audio volume, the airdopes have been lasting me about 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is decent for this price. The buds fit extremely well, except that they have fallen off a couple of time (but that maybe because of my ears). However, I have no complaints because I really think I didn't insert them into my ears fully and that's why they fell. Regardless, they are also comfortable and even after 3.5 hours, I haven't felt any discomfort or pain. So, all in all the quality of the earbuds (premium plastic) is awesome. I will give it a 4.5/5 for comfort and build quality.Note: After 20-days of usage, I have no complaint regarding the fit. Although they do seem to come out sometimes when your ears get too sweaty. So, moisture might cause them to come out. But it has only been a rare moment they did. I live in Mumbai, a humid city, and I haven't seen them come out a lot. But it did come out a couple of times during one workout.The charging case is premium quality too. It charges to full capacity in about two hours, which is good. It has a neat finish to it. I love the black on it and the red inside. Yes, I bought the Raging Red option. Boat only has black and red for now. More colors will be coming according to their Facebook page. However, I have always loved red.Inside the charging case, the earbuds have their own slots. Magnets are perfect.I wish the battery in both the earbuds lasted more than 4 hours but that's what they tell us in their features list. So, it gave me exactly that. It does its job, but I wish it had a 6 hour playback at least. But then for this price, maybe it is worth it. I think this is where Boat lacks. It provides a minimum playback compared to its competitors.Note: After 20 days of usage, I felt that the touch sensitivity could be better. The one-touch pause and play works for music player but doesn't work for Netflix and Prime and other apps. Which is weird. It starts music player again if song is in player queue. Maybe if I do a factory reset, it will be better. Will let you know regarding this. It might be a problem with mine alone because a few days ago, the touch sensitivity was awesome. Regardless, the sensitivity is still top-notch. I am finding the functionality confusing.Battery Life: 4/5Coming to calling, I think it did its job good. I could hear the other person's voice clearly. And I could hear him too. So I will give it a 4.5/5.Note: I'd not recommend this for calling but it does its job. Noise cancellation is decent.Lastly, I am coming to the best aspect of these airdopes. The Sound quality. Bass is just awesome. Trebles and mids  are decent. Vocals are good. I just enjoy listening to the songs on these airdopes. The beats are awesome. They are more or less similar to Boat 255 Pro Bluetooth, maybe even slightly better. So, sound quality, 5/5.Overall, I think this is the best true wireless buds you can find on a shoestring budget. Fit, quality, sound, noise cancellation, all good. Affordable too. So, I do recommend these airdopes if you are looking for something in the price range of 1.5k INR - 3.5k INR.Note: Boat Airdopes 441 and 451 are not much different. So, just the color.And ah yes, forgot, these airdopes have got IPx6 waterproofing. I haven't tested it as yet and don't want to risk it, but I gather that it will protect the buds from sweat and water droplets. :)Note: I am now 7 months into using this. The earphones still work with the same quality as received. However, there's a little glitch. Whenever the battery percentage drops by 10 or 20 per cent, it seems to disconnect. It reconnects automatically, but it can get annoying. Doesn't happen every time, but there's a frequency. Tried calling on these earphones as well. Good quality. Earphones run for at least 3.5 hours and a single battery charge for the case gives at least 3-4 charges. So, all in all, good.","If you are a fan of bass like I am, hell, you are gonna love these airdopes. I have been using Boat products for a while and haven't gone unsatisfied even if I feel the durability of said products could have been more. Sometimes, one earbuds stop to work. Happened many times. I had a boat 225 and then a Boat 255 Pro. But they had got one thing in common -- BASS. I'm a basshead and Boat products are a sure shot recommend.Of late, I had been researching a lot of true wireless earbuds. I checked out several including Redmi Earbuds S, MI TWS Earbuds, Blaupunkt BTW-01, Realme Earbuds X TWS, and a few others. I settled, however, on Boat 441 Airdopes as I have built this trust factor with Boat products and am very skeptical of going to any other, especially Boat really offers their audio equipments at an affordable price. I watched a lot of reviews for these Airdopes and settled on it finally. I am usually a paranoid person, but I am glad to say that I am satisfied at the moment with what I have purchased.This is a 3-day usage review. I will edit this review as I pass the 1-month,  3-month and 6-month marks. On the basis of my usage, I will let you know why I recommend it.Let me talk about the Amazon delivery first. Contactless and on time delivery even in these pandemic times. So, salute to the delivery heroes who are functioning even in these risky and dangerous times. Salute boss!The box came with a charging case that had two earbuds inside it, an advertisement foldable pamphlet, a USB Type-C cable, an instruction manual and a plastic case of two extra earbuds and hooks.The earbuds were at 80% charge when it arrived, but I had it charged full as soon as I opened the case. At 100% audio volume, the airdopes have been lasting me about 3 hours and 45 minutes, which is decent for this price. The buds fit extremely well, except that they have fallen off a couple of time (but that maybe because of my ears). However, I have no complaints because I really think I didn't insert them into my ears fully and that's why they fell. Regardless, they are also comfortable and even after 3.5 hours, I haven't felt any discomfort or pain. So, all in all the quality of the earbuds (premium plastic) is awesome. I will give it a 4.5/5 for comfort and build quality.Note: After 20-days of usage, I have no complaint regarding the fit. Although they do seem to come out sometimes when your ears get too sweaty. So, moisture might cause them to come out. But it has only been a rare moment they did. I live in Mumbai, a humid city, and I haven't seen them come out a lot. But it did come out a couple of times during one workout.The charging case is premium quality too. It charges to full capacity in about two hours, which is good. It has a neat finish to it. I love the black on it and the red inside. Yes, I bought the Raging Red option. Boat only has black and red for now. More colors will be coming according to their Facebook page. However, I have always loved red.Inside the charging case, the earbuds have their own slots. Magnets are perfect.I wish the battery in both the earbuds lasted more than 4 hours but that's what they tell us in their features list. So, it gave me exactly that. It does its job, but I wish it had a 6 hour playback at least. But then for this price, maybe it is worth it. I think this is where Boat lacks. It provides a minimum playback compared to its competitors.Note: After 20 days of usage, I felt that the touch sensitivity could be better. The one-touch pause and play works for music player but doesn't work for Netflix and Prime and other apps. Which is weird. It starts music player again if song is in player queue. Maybe if I do a factory reset, it will be better. Will let you know regarding this. It might be a problem with mine alone because a few days ago, the touch sensitivity was awesome.

I am really having such a bad experience using this Boat Airdopes 441 product. I ordered it on 10th June 2020. It's  28th and my left ear buds gets discharge in less than 10 minutes. I tried everything possible to cure the problem. I am not able to even factory reset it. The seller  has closed the window of return. It's my third Boat's product but I am having really tough time with this third one. I don't know what to do.

"I'm writing this one, as a follow up to my previous review/feedback.After around 2-3 months of following up with the boat customer service and after the complaint with the National Consumer forum I received the replacement for my original faulty product.Having said that, firstly the replaced product was not same in color and secondly this one was faulty too where the touch pad of the right earpod was not working.😠 Again being frustrated I raised another complaint with Boat. This time it took at least 3 weeks of time(which is okay with me as compared to the delay experience i had earlier) to get this faulty product replaced.Finally, I was happy with this 2nd time replaced product, everything in this one seemed perfect. But it has been just 15 days since I received the airdopes and now I find that the right ones battery gets exhausted within 15-20 mins after a full charge whereas the left one with the same amount of charge can run for more than an hour.I don't know what's wrong with this product or what's wrong with the Boat guys. This is literally frustrating for any customer. After replacing 2 times and waiting to receive a good product for more than 4 months of purchasing it still I'm hankering for it.All I wanted is to let you all know my experience with these airdopes. Now i literally realize that I wouldn't have purchased this product at all. I should have gone for some wired earphones which is far better than these or would have gone for some other company. I'm being cheated by Boat again and again.Customer service sucks... Neither they test a faulty product properly nor they test the one sending as a replacement. Then my question is why are they sitting over there?? Why they take so much of time to get us the replacement???","I'm writing this one, as a follow up to my previous review/feedback.After around 2-3 months of following up with the boat customer service and after the complaint with the National Consumer forum I received the replacement for my original faulty product.Having said that, firstly the replaced product was not same in color and secondly this one was faulty too where the touch pad of the right earpod was not working.😠 Again being frustrated I raised another complaint with Boat.

"1st thing is 1st.Amazon and the seller could have mentioned easily  mentioned that it's made in china and complied with govt.

"Bought the boat blue airdopes. Used it for 2days and it was working fine. But on the third day the connectivity started getting distorted even in the next room even with bending and moving. That was very disappointing. Also there was a constant tr tr tr.. noise in the left ear bud which is very low but it is noticeable. This noise only comes when the music is on. When the media stops playing the noise also stops. The voice calling is extremely poor. The person on the line will get a lot of background noise and the voice gets cracked, it was a very bad experience. So it is only suitable for listening to media. Ordered replacement. Hope the problem does not persist in the replaced model too.UPDATE : Got the replacement. The left bud noise is still there. It is lower than the previous pair. It seems like the problem persists in all products of this model. Think just have to ignore the noise.","Bought the boat blue airdopes. Used it for 2days and it was working fine.

"Recieved in two days after launch (priced 2500 during prime day launch, may jncreased upto 3499 later). Impressed with first look. Initially I was too confused in chosing earbud. From xiomi to  crossbeats to sony, I planned for everything. Unfortunately all had negative n positive reviews. So went for a fresh product and writing the review after 1 hr of use.Sound n music quality is good. Built is premium. 2600 mah case, type C charging is best. Ipx7 is added in pro.I bought it for calling purpose and I tested indoor n no one could differentiate that I was calling from earbud. So thumbs up.Hopefully in long run the review holds true!","Recieved in two days after launch (priced 2500 during prime day launch, may jncreased upto 3499 later). Impressed with first look.

"Just bought this boat 441 two days back. Here are my initial impressions after using for two days.So i am not an audiophile or something, but used pretty decent earphones from boat, sennheiser, samsung, sony, philips, mi, mivi etc. So after some research, i settled for this as it is not too much expensive. I did not opt for fast delivery, still amazon delivered within 2 days. Packaging was good and product was nicely sealed. Little surprised to see that the box was so small. It is funny that on the box very tactfully written made in P.R.C. The capsule shaped charging case is small, light weight, very much pocketable, and sturdy because of the build quality and doesn't feel cheap or flimsy. There is a led indicator defines charging status. Its nice to have a c-type port as it is future safe because nowadays almost every smartphones comes with c-type port. This comes in vibrant colours and i purchased the blue one. The buds are light weight and feels sturdy in hand. However, the fit was not good for me so i changed the shark fin rubber with the smaller one given in the box, also changed the ear tips to the smallest one given and now it fits perfectly to my ears. Well, fit is subjective, so i guess you should also play around with the extras to see which one fits you perfectly. The grip is really nice as i use it while brisk walking and doing little exercises and it never fall from my ears. Some users says there is some static noise problem but i didn't have this problem as of now. The touch sensitivity is pretty good and accurate, however, there can be accidental touch sometimes when trying to adjust the earbuds. I guess with time you will get to used to this thing. Now coming to the sound quality, it is definitely bass heavy with good trebles and vocals. The bass is not muddy but punchy, and didn't hurt my ears. Highs, lows and mids are clear. The sound signature is pretty good. Didn't noticed any latency during media consumptions, but can't comment about gaming latency as im a non-gamer. Volume can go very high, connection with my smartphone is quite fast and stable, range is pretty good. Didn't went outdoor, but indoor calling was good and the other party never realised i was on BT earphone. Once right side earbud stopped after i took it out of the box for a long time without connecting to the phone, but then i just put them back at the box and closed the lid and then after opening everything was working fine again. Can't judge the battery life as i am just using it for 2 days, but the buds charges pretty fast.Cons: Couldn't find any till now, and hope i won't be able to find any in near future.I hope my experience helps you decide whether to go for this earbuds on not. Thanks.","Just bought this boat 441 two days back.

They don't just drop off even during workouts, running. Since I'm a sports enthusiast I am able to say this.2) Coming to the quality of Sound. I would say they aren't the best. I'm sorry but thats true. I have OnePlus buds whose music quality is much better than airdopes. But OnePlus buds won't fit well. There will be chances of loosing them.3) Call quality is absolutely good when compared to many other brands of same price range in TWS category.4) These Dopes are best for sports enthusiasts who loves hard bass. If you are one then you would love them. More over they look absolutely cool when you wear them.Lime green, Red and Black are the best colors amongst the color options available.","The media could not be loaded.

Earbuds takes 15-20 min for charging in case and case takes almost 1 hour to get fully charged.Product look is very cute and stylish, also the silicon earplugs and  silicon side plugs (see the video) gives better support to fit it in ear.If you are planning to buy this product just don't think more, go and order it for you.

"Ordered it during sale, received it quickly enough. Pairing was easy, size of the charging case is nice and small. The magnets are strong to hold the buds in its place within case.

"It offers many impressive features and have an amazing look.... The case has been given smooth finish in addition to that, it provides a small pouch to keep the case..... It's overall appearance in one is stunning..... Now coming to the sound, audio products in india are tend to be stronger in bass, but the Boat Airdopes 441 perhaps takes this a bit too far.... Though it creats an ambience around you but the punch and aggression sometime is very fatiguing at all volumes..... The fittings of the earbuds are good, and it provides two sizes of the  rubber around it, so it accurately fits for all sizes of the ear. So if you are looking for a stylish, comfortable and secure fit airdopes which can provide a  magnificent sound with enough noise cancellation in around 2k-2.5k budget then you can definitely go for it.","It offers many impressive features and have an amazing look....

"Pros: Bass quality is fine. Bluetooth pairing at one go. Magnetic box is efficient for securing the earbuds. LED indicator is functioning properly.Cons: Brace yourself-Bluetooth connectivity lost arbitrarily in between music. Call quality is not upto the mark- sound is poor despite adjusting call volume, initial and end parts of a call are lost with almost no noise cancellation. No gesture or facility for volume control. With no buttons and only touch maneouvred gestures it is very difficult to adapt to listening music or calling for long hours. Gesture are congested and not user-friendly.Overall I would like to rate this a 3/5 for a budget bluetooth earphone.","Pros: Bass quality is fine. Bluetooth pairing at one go.

"When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441. Didn't want to invest a lot of money hence gone for it. I purchased it for 2999 and within days - it was priced at 2499.If you're looking for using these while working out - please don't. These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. This was my first ever purchase with boAt I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 1499.","When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441.

"COMFORT:I wear it during my workout I was worried that it will fall but the wing thing prevents it from falling. It not very comfortable when worn for a long duration.NOISE CANCELLATION:Don't have to worry about it wearing off easily 👍🏻. Noise cancellation is also great it blocks all the noise around you (fan, tv noises, etc...).BATTERY BACKUP:Battery backup is great I use it every day at night, during the workout (1hr) and sometime in the morning after all this, I have to charge it every 8-10 days.MIC:My only concern is the mic, while on phone some people, on the other hand, have complained about my voice (too low and breaking) but it just may be because of my low volume speak, so anyone who have low pitch speaks you would have to speak a little louder.CAPACITIVE BUTTON:The touch buttons are too sensitive, so during a workout the song stop sometimes because of my shoulder or my shirt. Also during a call, if  I have to remove the ""AirDopes"" my hand would accidentally touch the capacitive button and the call gets disconnected (one solution to this is to first disconnect them from the phone first, then remove them).SOUND QUALITY:I have no complaints about the sound quality. The bass is PERFECT not too much (as seen earlier on older boat products, they fix it I guess).  The high and low are also clear.","COMFORT:I wear it during my workout I was worried that it will fall but the wing thing prevents it from falling.

"I bought musili vv1 for 1999 prior to buying this. It's louder compared to this. But lacks in quality of sound. So i returned muzili vv1 and ordered this one. It's my 6th boat headset over the years and yes boat delivers quality.These airdopes are a bit of trouble if worn for over 45 mins. As many users have complained about and uneasy headache, I too faced it and had to remove it often. The headphones are not loud enough as one would expect them to be. So i tweaked my dolby atmos and max'd all the Equalizers to get the desired sound and yet it lacked somewhere. However the clarity, highs and lows and deep bass are great. It took roughly 3 hrs on full volume to deplete the battery to 50 %.Sadly It's made in china and I will be returning it","I bought musili vv1 for 1999 prior to buying this.

"2 months of usage and previous unit replaced so updating the review.. the bluetooth issue is resolved in replaced piece, so overall it's a good product with balanced sound at good price if purchased under 2400*****Roughly 1 day of usage, bluetooth disconnecting soon as soon as u get little away from device.. or even when you use one earbud and keep other away with phone with you, it will cut u out.. that itself was worrysome but now I connected with my android set top box for TV viewing and it's not connecting constantly. Though TV is right in front of me 3m away. Even Boat rocker headphone I use otherwise works better than this.These things are not being told or checked in youtube reviews availble strangely, either they are paid reviews or they don't check thoroughly.Ear grip is good, sound is reasonable but when I was watching BBT on prime video, sound was relatively low. So overall it seems a good buy if u just want to use it in both ear with phone in pocket all the time or for some gaming. Call was disrupted too couple of times..Probably will return this unless Boat provides a solution to bluetooth issue.","2 months of usage and previous unit replaced so updating the review.. the bluetooth issue is resolved in replaced piece, so overall it's a good product with balanced sound at good price if purchased under 2400*****Roughly 1 day of usage, bluetooth disconnecting soon as soon as u get little away from device.. or even when you use one earbud and keep other away with phone with you, it will cut u out.. that itself was worrysome but now I connected with my android set top box for TV viewing and it's not connecting constantly.

So overall it seems a good buy if u just want to use it in both ear with phone in pocket all the time or for some gaming. Call was disrupted too couple of times..Probably will return this unless Boat provides a solution to bluetooth issue.",month usage previous unit replace update review bluetooth issue resolve replace piece overall good product balanced sound good price purchase roughly day usage bluetooth disconnect soon soon u get little away device even use one earbud keep away phone cut u worrysome I connect android set top box tv view not connect constantly though tv right front I away even boat rocker headphone I use otherwise work well thing not tell check youtube review availble strangely either pay review not check thoroughly ear grip good sound reasonable I watch bbt prime video sound relatively low overall seem good buy u want use ear phone pocket time gaming call disrupt couple time probably return unless boat provide solution bluetooth issue

"These in-ear head phones tick a lot of boxes for me:1: Budget2: decent sound3: Good Bass4: Average Noise Cancellation (due to snug fitting ear tips)5: The stylish lights on the rims which match the Edge Lighting of the Samsung Galaxy phones.If you wonder, why I have given them a 3 🌟 rating despite so many of my boxes being ticked is due to the overly sensitive touch pads.These fit perfectly inside the ear and don't look ugly but they are absolutely no good to me while sleeping.When your head presses against the pillow, either the audio/video gets paused / Google assistant activates or worst of all thar particular ear piece gets shut down.For me this was a major low  unfortunately no option for a half star so 3 stars.","These in-ear head phones tick a lot of boxes for me:1: Budget2: decent sound3: Good Bass4: Average Noise Cancellation (due to snug fitting ear tips)5: The stylish lights on the rims which match the Edge Lighting of the Samsung Galaxy phones.If you wonder, why I have given them a 3 🌟 rating despite so many of my boxes being ticked is due to the overly sensitive touch pads.These fit perfectly inside the ear and don't look ugly but they are absolutely no good to me while sleeping.When your head presses against the pillow, either the audio/video gets paused / Google assistant activates or worst of all thar particular ear piece gets shut down.For me this was a major low  unfortunately no option for a half star so 3 stars.",ear head phone tick lot box budget decent sound good bass average noise cancellation due snug fitting ear tips stylish light rim match edge lighting samsung galaxy phones wonder I give rating despite many box tick due overly sensitive touch pads fit perfectly inside ear not look ugly absolutely no good I sleeping head press pillow either audiovideo gets pause google assistant activate bad thar particular ear piece gets shut I major low unfortunately no option half star star
"I would keep it short and pointed out:1. Connectivity is pretty nice - connects instantly on lid open.2. Seamless stereo/mono switch - works fantastic every time. No issues faced3. Build is pretty good - for the price, the build quality is really good. The LED is fantastic i must say4. Touch - the touch is just, well, too good. It takes up at any point, the slightest of touches and that MIGHT be irritating at times5. Sound - in one word, GOOD! Actually good is being really vague. The bass is punchy but not overwhelming. Bassheads will not be really sad with this. Instrument separation is good even though the mids are a little muffled. Pure vocal artists will lose the edge there. The punch will be really high in songs like Get Lucky, Madness etc. So yes, for this price point, the sound is good.6. Fit - perfect fit, doesn’t fall off. But sadly, very subjective, hurts my ears after 45 minutes or so. If your ears don’t hurt, go nuts doing any exercise you want.7. Passive noise cancellation - brilliant but with an underside of not hearing ANYTHING AT ALL from outside. So keep that in mind and do the needful when out wearing them.I cannot comment on the battery or long term issues. I have used it for my runs and casual listening. For the price, this is really a decent bud pair!!","I would keep it short and pointed out:1. Connectivity is pretty nice - connects instantly on lid open.2.

"Got them in prime day sale (blue colour)Using since past 2 days.Using themJust forget that it need to be charged also (both case and dopes).

"So I bought this product from Amazon, honestly it was a bang for the buck. Nice fidelity, bass, comfortable and not so expensive.  All was good for a month and then one side stopped working, so I reached out to boat and they asked me to ship the product and they confirmed they received it. They abruptly cut all the ties with me after that, they dont respond to my emails asking status,  no response on twitter, helpline not going through.  The ticket number is 1540334 and they didnt respond to me for the past 1 month. Stay away from any Boat product, rather than that go for some brand who will respond to you or buy a cheap one and toss it of when stops working.Update: oct 25th. Finally they sent a replacemet earbuds.  So changing the ratimg from 1 to 2.","So I bought this product from Amazon, honestly it was a bang for the buck.

"Review editing after a few months of use: The mic on the earphones is very cheap quality and the audio quality over calls is pathetic. It sounds very muddled, as if you are talking under water. Another major problem is one of the earphones randomly shuts off within 30mins of use and cannot be used again before putting it back in the charging case. This is disappointing for me as bought these with the intend to wear them on long cycling sessions (min 1hr).I am an audiophile,  so would like to talk mostly about audio quality. I bought these for casual listening, specially for cycling in monsoon. The highs and mids are pretty decent for the price you pay, but when it comes to low frequencies, the bass is too boomy for my liking (note: this is coming from a guy who likes to listen to his music on vinyl). The bass is not tight and is all-over the low ends which causes highs and mids to subside. Having said that, they are decent pair of earphones and are pretty manageable (sound quality wise) even for an audiophile like me. Would have given 5 stars, had they kept the bass under control.","Review editing after a few months of use: The mic on the earphones is very cheap quality and the audio quality over calls is pathetic.

"Let's go straight to the points.Pros.1. Though it has 6mm drivers, it produces sound quality like having 10mm drivers.2. Overall balanced output of treble, bass, voice quality makes it a perfect choice under 2k. Even 2.5k doesn't really bothers much.3. Touch sensor never fails.4. IPX 7 protection is a bonus point comparative to other products under the same price range.5. That extra rubber around the TWS holds them perfectly within your ears n let's you be more confident to do your movements more freely.6. The magnets are really strong so jus relax they are not going to fall out of the box/case.7. Speaking on phone calls is a breeze surprisingly in indoor and they're quite impressive even in outdoors.8. Other features like led indications, auto pair, type c cable, good battery backup, light weight etc all together makes this product a paisa wasul one.Cons.I'm trying to find them out and when I do, I'll update my review for sure.I've used many headphones 🎧 already, n since I'm using this one it makes me feel like, aahh why didn't I bought it before! 😃Also bought another one for my colleague and the big smile on his face tells the story itself 💁🏻‍♂️😀","Let's go straight to the points.Pros.1.

"I bought these a few days back, and as soon as I paired it with my phone, I could hear a constant static noise from the left earbud. I thought it would go away after some time, unfortunately even after 1-2 days, it did not. I tried it with my OnePlus 5T, Windows laptop, iPad, all of them gave the sound on the left side. The right side worked without issue. So I thought it might be a faulty product and ordered a replacement, and when the replacement arrived, it still had the same issue. It is very annoying and highly noticeable at times like dialogues without any music/ scenes when there is not much audio in movies, especially at volumes anything lower than 25%. Above that, if it is boomy music, it gets masked and you can't hear it, but it is still there as I could hear it during silent parts.Apart from this issue, the bass on this is pretty unsatisfactory, although it might be okay as compared to some cheap wired earphones.Pairing is fast and works as advertised, and so does the battery.I found the noise really annoying and I ended up returning it.","I bought these a few days back, and as soon as I paired it with my phone, I could hear a constant static noise from the left earbud.

"Guys, seriously, give this one a pass. This and other similar boAt products (Rockerz) are just poor pieces of tech which will remain in dumpyards and pollute our planet for years.These Airdopes actually feel like they're high on dope - sometimes they pair like a breeze, sometimes they don't. There are instances where the sound comes through only on one of the earpieces, whereas on other instances both work fine. The mic for capturing speech works at times, when it feels like. Otherwise, the other party doesn't hear you at all.I would rather save myself the hassle and spend a bit extra on a Sony/JBL which will actually work and last me for a while.As of now, I have two pieces of marble (the earpieces), one mini jewellery box (the charging case), all containing tech and batteries which need to be dumped in a landfill. What a waste.","Guys, seriously, give this one a pass.

"I use this product everyday, for media consumption on both phone and computer, and i use for phone calls as well. It went ok for first two weeks. After that, I had to regularly format it due to bluetooth connectivity issues. After 1 and half month use, sound transmission stop frequently to a point where it would not transmit any audio for as long as 5 seconds after every 2 seconds. I claimed warranty on Boat's website, it has now been 8 full days since then and I have not heard anything from Boat. No one has contacted me for picking up my device for servicing or replacement. Would definitely not recommend based on my experience alone.","I use this product everyday, for media consumption on both phone and computer, and i use for phone calls as well.

 The product is amazing at its price of 2300INR when i bought. The main reason is for the cool colors which Masaba has designed. Other TWS is more of vanilla when compared to this.Coming to build quality: Im more than satisfied since after 6 months usage i have dropped it here and there but thankfully no damage yet.Sound quality is comparable to other market competition such as one plus buds, mivi etc.Battery life is commendable, after daily usage of 3-4 hrs and charging box 2 times a week.If you are for the looks and ok with sound quality dont hesitate go for it.","The media could not be loaded.

"Pros:- Sound is OK- Heavy bass- Value for money (You get just enough value for what you paid; don't get fooled thinking you got a great TWS earphones at a bargain)Cons:- Painful: The casing pushes against your ear and causes discomfort after few mins. You feel like your whole ear is occupied. I have tried Airpods style earphones and they are much better. Only the eartip goes into your ear canal, and the rest of your ear will thank you for the freedom.- Useless touch controls: Horrible touch controls that just like to flash some colorful lights, god knows what is the meaning of the lights. You have to keep it continuously pressed and hope what the manual says will actually work.- Difficult pairing: The first pairing is easy since it is ready to pair when you open the box for the fist time. Subsequent device pairing is excruciatingly painful due to the above issue of touch controls. The instructions says long press 5 secs to turn off and long press 3 secs to turn off. The touch controls just keep flashing some lights and don't give you any feedback as to whether it is taking your inputs or not. Of course, it did not turn off as advertised.","Pros:- Sound is OK- Heavy bass- Value for money (You get just enough value for what you paid; don't get fooled thinking you got a great TWS earphones at a bargain)Cons:- Painful: The casing pushes against your ear and causes discomfort after few mins.

"Opened the pack to find a cute earbud. Was impressed with ease of use. The plastic on the outside looks cheap, but felt comfortable on the ear. Good look for the price. Was very happy on the initial use of work call and music during work. Trouble started on day 2, when I used it for workout. Even a slight touch on the left pod starts iTunes. This was a big annoyance as I was listening to something off iTunes. Then tried connecting to my Android, but it wasn't pairing. On day 3, when I opened the case, the left pod wasnt charged and ran out of battery again soon. Returned it to get another box, which had left pod charging issues repeatedly. Ended up returning that too.","Opened the pack to find a cute earbud. Was impressed with ease of use. The plastic on the outside looks cheap, but felt comfortable on the ear. Good look for the price.

"Just delivered. Started using it. Not going into techno babble, I am going to record my initial observations:1. One day delivery by Amazon. Got it at Rs. 2499.2. Great packing by BoAt, looks neat and organized.3. A bit heavier case considering the extra juice stored in the battery to be used as a power bank in case of 'emergencies'.4. Instant battery level indicator on the case by pressing an associated button on the front of the case.5. Instant searching by the pods when I opened the case, denoted by blinking green light (looks cool).6. On pairing mode the ring of light alternates in green and blue light, the pairing is easy and hassle free.7. The sound after connecting is something I wouldn't say as balanced but on the bass heavy side, but Boat sure knows to make bass heavy earpieces.8. As happened with my earlier Boat wired earpieces, the default eartips/buds had to be replaced with the largest of the extra tips provided in the box and like my previous experience, the sound quality changed and became more balanced although it was still bass heavy and if one can corre tly set equalizer values, the sound may sound better. It is my personal viewpoint and observations.9. The touch may seem to be confusing as the number of tap one has to make and I found that I made more taps than what I should have reuired to do for changing to next track and thus was annoying. However, I believe to be adapted to it after more use. However, having said that, I felt that the after-tap response is a miniscule bit late thereby creating the confusion of tapping.10. There is no volume control option in the earpiece but I found a novel way to do so by pairing both these airdopes and Honor band 5 (with a music control update) with my mobile phone. It worked and still works like magic and guess it is more cool to do so by changing, pausing, controlling volume by a smart band rather than tapping on the airdopes.11. Tested call in outdoors and indoors- in home and in a moving car with other people present. In quieter environment the call is clearer. Having said that for both the cases, the call was quite good even if not HD quality. Still haven't used in a street call. Will update the call quality after another few days of usage.12. The ring of light across the touch area is a dope. I really liked it amd was one of the reason in buying this airdopes, but sadly, I found that they were not lighting up when the song plays and lights up only when certain functions happen. Green for charged condition and searching, Blue-green alternate for pairing and red when tapped on the earpiece. I don't know whether that feature can be turned off or not in these airdopes.13. The battery of the airdopes stood out to 50% after 3 hours of continuous music usage. The battery indicator light on the case has four dots and after 5 hours, 3 dots were visible, thus I conclude that there will be ample juice left for the whole day for a heavy usage.WILL UPDATE AFTER ANOTHER ONE WEEK USAGE.","Just delivered.

"These are some good truly wireless earphones in the market right now that don't burn a hole in your pockets. Fits snuggly in your ear ( but won't remain there for long if you do a rigorous exercise), good noise cancellation, great audio quality, reliable connection up to 6-8 metres and the flickering LEDs are some good points I can think right now. The battery life is good and lasts about 3-4 hours on a single charge. The total times the buds can be charged from the case is good too and practically you won't be able to keep track on the count. It will last easily for weeks. The power bank functionality of the case comes in handy. That's a good feature.So far good. The call quality over the Bluetooth is pretty bad. Yes, bad. Most of the time you won't be able to hear the other person and he wouldn't be able to hear you completely. These buds as headsets perform really poor. So not recommended for that purpose.

Amazing product.. really awsome. It exceed the expectations. You all know that now a days earbuds are available from the starting price range of 1800 to 30000 around. For this boat airpodes it cost 2400/-. So I was expecting just average sound quality and features. But it just brow me away with its punching bass and features. It mentioned only 6mm driver unit in it. It really makes me wonder how a 6mm driver can give such an amazing sound quality with literary ear drum vibrating bass effect. Oh God. Totally unexpected. Thanks Boat giving such amazing product in such an affordable price range. This boat company is winning the trust and love of many customers. Im sure within max of 10 years span, Boat company is going to become a very establish brand.","Even though Iam a regular buyer through Amazon, I very rarely use to write review.

"My biggest issue with this, is the comfort!I can't wear it for more than 20-30min without my ears hurting.It creates a sort of vacuum in your ear as well, I guess to enhance sound and as it needs to stay put properly.The sound quality: I cannot complain. It is just wonderful.I can run on the treadmill with the Airdopes in my ears, I can jump around and it won't fall off.Process of connecting is also seamless; auto-connect feature works perfectly (Oneplus 6T)For online classes/meetings: Microphone is just alright.

"Pros-Very nice sound.feels like you are in movie hall.touch controls are working perfectly but sometimes normal incidental touch can perform the action.look cool and good, I have Lime colour.the box can also be used as an emergency power bank for your mobile too. (That's a good feature)auto-connects when you open the box.looks rich and people ask you about this.Extra buds and supporters have given.Cons-Not for Calls repeat NOT FOR CALLS.if you are in outer place with the public or in traffic, the other side person on call will hear only traffic and other background noises. I personally feel it. I think the noise cancellation feature is just to write in product description this does not actually work.if you are a music lover then it's for you only but again if it does not fulfill the calling feature then why should we waste so much money? I am going to return it.Please like or rate my review.","Pros-Very nice sound.feels like you are in movie hall.touch controls are working perfectly but sometimes normal incidental touch can perform the action.look cool and good, I have Lime colour.the box can also be used as an emergency power bank for your mobile too.

"At start I was confused whether to go for this airdopes Or not but after checking multiple reviews on Amazon YouTube & multiple other platform, I circled to go for it. The best thing about this airdope is that you can use it at anytime , under no conditions you will feel that it will be coming out of your ear,The design & bass quality is damn good. Yes after using the airdope for long hours you can feel a little pain due to rubber attached in airdopes but safety is first. So overall for good music, bass & using the airdopes while doing exercise as well this is a go to product.","At start I was confused whether to go for this airdopes Or not but after checking multiple reviews on Amazon YouTube & multiple other platform, I circled to go for it.

"Pros:1) Good sound quality2) Decent call quality (as good as can be expected from an ear-pod). Not perfect though so if your requirement is more for calls then consider other options. If requirement is more for songs/movies and few calls then you can go for it.3) Nice charging case4) Durable : My kid dropped it in a glass of water. I immediately took it out and to my surprise it didn't stop workingCons:1) If not put properly, your ear will start aching after few minutes2) Touch button for calling/disconnect so if you adjust the ear pod in the middle of a call, more often than not it will disconnect the call3) There is a slight lag in reaction time which is not a deal breaker as you get used to it.","Pros:1) Good sound quality2) Decent call quality (as good as can be expected from an ear-pod).

"The fit for my ears is great and with different sized eartips provided would be so for many others as well .Sound quality is mediocre .

And the battery life suddenly and dramatically goes down just after warranty period ends ? This is a crystal clear case of planned obsolescence .The box says the MRP is 6000rs , which is way overpriced for a highly mediocre set of earbuds . 1700 is much more reasonable .In short , boat airdopes 441 is a highly mediocre set of earbuds with overpromising and flamboyant marketing that ultimately disappoint .I'd only recommend them if you're planning to use them for 6-7 months","The fit for my ears is great and with different sized eartips provided would be so for many others as well .Sound quality is mediocre .

"I purchased this on the Prime day sale, thinking it would be one of a kind, 'true wireless' earphones with the inbuilt 2600mAH power bank. Well, I stand dissappointed!!Well, if you are looking for a power bank you'll get something better in Rs. 500. You don't need to spend, so much money on a power bank that pretends to be a earphone. Actually, I can't blame boat for this, their marketing was spot on, and not to forget the amount of paid reviews on YouTube were all a catalyst for this buying. Anyway, I'll give you an honest review about my experience with this power bank aka ✌️true wireless ✌️Pros:1. Power bank (2600mAh, you can even charge your phone, only for emergencies), else it gives you around 120 hours of earphones playback time.2. Good ear plugs, and the added fins around it fits perfectly within your ear lobes. Doesn't slip out or cause discomfort.3. Decent bass, and loud.Cons:1. Battery Backup - The problem with this earphones is that the discharge rate way higher than any earphones I've used. Playback /call time is way less than 4.5hrs as claimed by the boat. On a single charge, for calls got around 2hrs and for music playback 2.5hrs. These are individuals stats, but if you're doing both of these activities, you'll get an average of 2hrs.2. Call Quality: Single Pod - Not at all clear and crisp as mentioned by many YouTube and Amazon reviewers. I've always had people telling me from the other end that, they can't hear me clearly or the voice they hear echoes. When you use both the earphones, the voice is a little clear but not to a greater extent. This is not something you would expect from a Rs. 3500 earphones( current rate, I got it for 2500).3. Connectivity : The earphones keeps disconnecting from the phone, and that's when I've my phone in my pocket. At first, I thought probably my phone is behaving weird, but I tried my friend's phone, and it kept disconnecting. It also keeps disconnecting from my laptop as well. So, I see no point why anyone should buy this when the sole purpose of being a true wireless has already been defeated.I rest my case.","I purchased this on the Prime day sale, thinking it would be one of a kind, 'true wireless' earphones with the inbuilt 2600mAH power bank.

"If you are looking for true bass, then I would not recommend this. While it is good and high on music, it isn't as thumping as mentioned. One of the buds not working is a common problem and restarting/rebooting is the only option to fix it. Fixes perfectly with the ear and ears don't pain even after couple of hours of usage. It does work for 3.5 hours non-stop. No issues with calling.Biggest Drawback: They work pathetically bad with laptops. Right from connectivity to touch sensors to music shuffling (especially on YouTube, everything lags at regular intervals. Bottom line is they are just not made for laptops but if you still want to use it then be prepared to use your hands on keyboard and delayed sound.","If you are looking for true bass, then I would not recommend this.

"Well for the first time I'm using the term ''disappointed'' for boAt but this time you people have failed to live upto the expectations.I had purchased boAt 441 on 15 June, 2020 which got delivered on 18 June,2020. My overall experience was okayish as the bass quality and the voice quality was pretty decent until today (28 June,2020).My audio device is not working as the person on the other side can not hear a word i say. The whole purpose of buying this headphone is defeated. Considering the work from home scenario I had purchased it to make myself comfortable while attending the 'n' number of calls I get; however, the comfort was short-lived. I hope I get a better replacement for this faulty device.","Well for the first time I'm using the term ''disappointed'' for boAt but this time you people have failed to live upto the expectations.I had purchased boAt 441 on 15 June, 2020 which got delivered on 18 June,2020.

Perfect bass and treble balance.• My works requires a lot of calling so I was just hoping that they would work. And they work like a charm! Not once I have got a complaint from anyone regarding low audio or background noise and stuff. Too good!• Looks are simply decent and amazing.• Fits perfectly.• Connectivity is superb! Just you open the case and you won't be able to remove the buds and it will get connected!• Battery backup is great! Worked nearly 5-6 hours including regular Calling and songs.If you want to go ahead with a reasonable true wireless piece then don't think anymore. Go with this one.

"I have used one plus buds Z , and various other buds. The sound quality which these buds give are unmatched. Trust me the Bass is like the best you can experience.The battery charge and charging everything is good.The main thing is you have to change the silicon according to your ear size to get the best effect.Trust me you will go into another world if you hear music or watch a movie. For that reason alone this is the best buy.Forget about the negative reviews. I never had issued with left buds or anything. May be I got a good piece and i am lucky, even if you did Amazon and boat are the best in customer satisfaction. So go Blindly for it. If you get it for 1800 in offer, then these buds are the number one.","I have used one plus buds Z , and various other buds. The sound quality which these buds give are unmatched.

"I received this earbud on 25 Aug and when I connected to my phone everything was good but when changing the track from my phone/ earbud, there is no sound coming.

It's happening with YouTube, Spotify, Gaana, and every other app.Then I replaced this and got today dated 28 Aug but it even worse.

 I got it delivered on 14th may. Fully charged it and i am writing this review on 21st may. 1 week later the case still has 2 dots worth of charge. I use the Airdopes daily for calls and music during work hours and while watching YouTube at night. Connection is fast, open the case and it connects to the last device before you even reach out to pick them up. Sound is good if correct ear buds are used. With all that said, it does cause some pain if worn for extended duration specially the rubber flap type thing. I tried replacing it with the smaller flap that comes with it but still causes a little pain. Maybe its just the shape of my ear is weired.","The media could not be loaded.

"This is my first time with wireless earphones. I ordered this because the reviews were satisfactory and I was not disappointed.These airdopes have great sound quality. The bass is awesome. I don’t prefer too loud music so it suits my requirement. It’s microphone is fairly good but yes you do have to speak a little louder. The charge doesn’t drop quickly, however I don’t use it all the time, just once a day for 30-45 minutes. It also fits well into my ears.I got it for 1700/- bucks and I am pretty happy with the product.","This is my first time with wireless earphones.

"Been a premium Amazon Prime customer for several years now... this experience is an absolute unacceptable all time LOW.Box original seal was opened and re sealed with cello tape... very evidently tampered or some used returned product was sent to me. Signs of previous usage and ear wax clear on the product in the images attached. This is totally disgusting and unacceptable by the Amazon retailer. Product didn't work obviously... not surprised that it was previously returned.

"6-Jul-2021: Quality is okay and as per the price paid so no complaint. But battery is awful. You cannot have 1 hour call on this. During office call, I noticed left bud is out at 45min. Switched to speakerphone on mobile. It happened in another call too. Each time Battery was fully charged before the call and battery is out at 45-50 min with left bud. Boat is marketing battery for 5 hour. That is either flat out lie or poor quality control.Also why rating for this product is so high? Yes rating at Amazon can be manipulated but there seems too many positive rating with this earbud. Maybe I am just unlucky. Will try the replacement.7-Jul-2021: battery time of replacement is 2.5 hour only. One more issue, if you touch your ear during call, call will switch out of bluetooth, you need to select bluetooth options again in call. Same issue with WhatsApp, MS Teams or Zoom call. Poor usability design. On this product return doesn't exist so have to keep it. Not happy for wasting over 2K on this.","6-Jul-2021: Quality is okay and as per the price paid so no complaint.

I got it delivered yesterday.  Everything is good. But my left ear bud is having a technical glitch type sound while playing any music and it is very disturbing to the ears. But I have full faith on Amazon. I have requested for a replacement.  I have full faith that in my next delivery the problem will be fixed.It was a technical problem. Just a faulty piece maybe. Other than that the product is really good. Took just an hour to full charge when taken out from the box first.,I got it delivered yesterday.  Everything is good.

"I bought the neon yellow pair last year in the Amazon Diwali sale. After reading reviews, I decided on the AirDopes Pro because of the extra battery life. I primarily wanted to use them for the gym, for HIIT and heavy cardio and also for watching videos and movies on my phone.I am writing this after almost a year of using them. Overall, I am very disappointed with the defects in the product that have developed over a year and poor customer service.ISSUESBattery Life - AS LISTED, works for way more than the time listed. The case once charged lasted me for around 3-4 weeks, based on a minimum usage of 1-2 hours daily, some days even 4-5 hours.Comfort - they are a comfortable fit, no headaches or any pain in the ear after a year of using them.Touch controls - touch is tricky; in my right bud, the touch works sometimes and sometimes not. Sometimes the bud will turn off without any touch and at other times, repeated touch with the flashing light won't make it change the song. So this aspect is difficult to judge.Sound quality - I listen to EDM in the gym and slow music at other times. Bass is non-existent. the sound quality is nothing to brag about, it is pretty much neutral but that is not why you bought this so do not expect that from these buds.Working - you can use one bud at a time, and leave the other one in the case to charge (to prolong battery life if you are running low or if you only want to listen from one ear). but you will loose the touch controls of whichever bud you are not using (right - track forward, left - track reverse; can be switched off with either).Call - you CANNOT TAKE A CALL on these. they do not work for that, do not buy if you WFH and need these for a call, you will be disappointed and you cannot return them.OTHER CONS- when i got these, there was some background noise in the left bud which would not go away. even after activating my warranty, the company (amazon and boat both) refused to exchange or return these. after some time, the noise went away but i was disappointed at the absence of help through amazon, whose customer service is really good at other times. BE CAREFUL THAT YOU CANNOT RETURN THESE, AND THEY WONT LET YOU EXCHANGE THEM EITHER. the left bud noise issue is present with other reviewers also (I checked later) and remains unsolved and random.- I lost one of my buds two months ago, and there is no way to find it back. No separate application is available for this so just be careful.- the sound quality of my right bud has deteriorated over the past few months (since June, around 10 months after i bought these), and the sound is now so low that I cannot even hear them properly. I regularly clean it and the case, and charge it on time but this issue has not gone away. BE CAREFUL THAT YOU MIGHT EXPERIENCE DETIRIORATION OF SOUND QUALITY IN A LESS THAN A YEAR. My brother got the same set in a different colour, and BOTH HIS BUDS have experienced the same sound quality deterioration so this issue is not just limited to my buds.OVERALL - if you can afford a better set of buds, save your money and buy that. There is no point in spending around 3-4k on this only to do that again next year. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND.","I bought the neon yellow pair last year in the Amazon Diwali sale.

"Very poor quality product -1. While using for calls, you sound very hollow to the person in the other side. I’ve been told I sounded like I was in a tunnel !2. Sound quality is poor - too much treble and that is hard on your ears when conversations are dominant - that’s normally the case with calls.3. The touch system is total BS - if you touch to adjust position during a call , the call gets cut. If you decide to take it off since it doesn’t work well, the call gets cut. The touch is ultra sensitive and you can’t bring your fingers close to the buds without doing something unintended. Horrible design- far from consumer centric.Otherwise, it is fine - pairs easily. Holds charge (esp since it is sparingly used ).","Very poor quality product -1. While using for calls, you sound very hollow to the person in the other side.

"I got these airdopes during the sale offer. And in less than 2 weeks started facing issues...1. The bass is overly bassy! You can't listen to anything else but thumping bass... No mids or highs whatsoever2. The left earphone was sounding weaker than the right one, I checked all settings and even changed devices to understand if I'm doing something wrong, but it still was the same3. The charging case has a mind of its own! I used to use the earphones twice a day, early morning run and late morning gymming... The other times the pods will sit in the case. Now the case would loose it's own charge within a day in just 3 hours of total usage!I have sent the airdopes back for warranty, but haven't heard back on any status updates. When I called to check on the given phone number, the agent was super clueless! His only response was ""someone from our side will contact you when we're done, give us 15 days"" 🤦🏽‍♂️It was a mistake buying these, save some cash and but something more reliable","I got these airdopes during the sale offer.

"Battery does not last as long as the company claim. Phone gets connected very often as you try to adjust the headphone in ears while putting it on.Also, very often only one side ear phone gets connected and its a struggle to connect the otherone.Overall, NOT worth the money they charge for it. I had to return to wired headphones than using this one for the non-stop office alls. This is not a convenient one!","Battery does not last as long as the company claim.

"I'm giving this review after using this Airdopes for 6months. It's nice while using and comfortable wearing whether you're in gym or out.Not good for talking you can't talk over the phone while using this Boat Airdopes 441 pro , person won't be able to hear your voice properly with it. So not good for talking.But after 6 months it stopped working even not connecting to my phone as it used to get connected. So I raised complaint to claim warranty but  Boat provides pathetic services I could say😡, first Boat customer care doesn't reply to your call and mails, I had to do a lot to connect with them. After that they provided me too far service centre's addresses to visit to claim my warranty. Somehow I myself searched nearest Boat service centre and went their they asked me to submit my Airdopes with the problems I mentioned. Boat Team told me that I'll get replacement of this Airdopes under their policy, which will be couriered to me shortly.But after couple of days they sent me the same Airdopes with the problems I was facing at my address. Which is highly disappointing!!I again mailed them about this incident and it took almost about one month just to get the warranty claim after my continuous efforts otherwise Boat would not have given me the warranty.My question is why Boat doesn't provide smooth services and if Boat has one year warranty for their headphones you're supposed to give customers hassle free and good services because it's not our fault that your Airdopes doesn't work after 3-4 months of uses or stops working😡","I'm giving this review after using this Airdopes for 6months.

"Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks. She went for a walk in the forest. Pretty soon, she came upon a house. She knocked and, when no one answered, she walked right in.At the table in the kitchen, there were three bowls of porridge. Goldilocks was hungry. She tasted the porridge from the first bowl.""This porridge is too hot!"" she exclaimed.So, she tasted the porridge from the second bowl.""This porridge is too cold,"" she said.So, she tasted the last bowl of porridge.""Ahhh, this porridge is just right,"" she said happily and she ate it all up.After she'd eaten the three bears' breakfasts, she decided she was feeling a little tired. So, she walked into the living room where she saw three chairs. Goldilocks sat in the first chair to rest.""This chair is too big!"" she exclaimed.So she sat in the second chair.""This chair is too big, too!"" she whined.So she tried the last and smallest chair.""Ahhh, this chair is just right,"" she sighed. But just as she settled down into the chair to rest, it broke into pieces!Goldilocks was very tired by this time, she went upstairs to the bedroom. She lay down in the first bed, but it was too hard. Then she lay in the second bed, but it was too soft. Then she lay down in the third bed and it was just right. Goldilocks fell asleep.As she was sleeping, the three bears came home.""Someone's been eating my porridge,"" growled the Papa bear.""Someone's been eating my porridge,"" said the Mama bear.""Someone's been eating my porridge and they ate it all up!"" cried the Baby bear.""Someone's been sitting in my chair,"" growled the Papa bear.""Someone's been sitting in my chair,"" said the Mama bear.""Someone's been sitting in my chair and they've broken it to pieces,"" cried the Baby bear.They decided to look around some more and when they got upstairs to the bedroom, Papa bear growled,""Someone's been sleeping in my bed.”""Someone's been sleeping in my bed, too"" said the Mama bear.""Someone's been sleeping in my bed and she's still there!"" exclaimed the Baby bear.Just then, Goldilocks woke up. She saw the three bears. She screamed, ""Help!"" And she jumped up and ran out of the room. Goldilocks ran down the stairs, opened the door, and ran away into the forest. She never returned to the home of the three bears.THE ENDThanks for reading the story. BTW product is awesome.","Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Goldilocks.

"So, I had tempered my expectations from this pair of earbuds mainly due to the price. There are just so many products populating this price-range that it's kinda overwhelming. Having said that, if music-quality is the main metric for you, these earbuds just might be it.PROS:- Excellent bass, as advertised. I played a lot of songs with different bass types to test out what these earbuds could do- and they were fantastic!- The bass is punch yet well-defined. There's little to no distortion or sludginess in the low-end.- It'll make you happy if you like either the thumpy bass of hip-hop or the groovy bass-lines in classic rock or funk.- The mids are strong and vibrant for a pair of relatively inexpensive earbuds.- The earbuds themselves look great and feel well designed.- The build quality of the buds is pretty good-quality plastic.CONS:- The case doesn't seem to be very well constructed. The lid is especially a bit wobbly. You'll have to take care no to bump or drop the case.- Also, the case is fairly devoid of any features that are offered in other products in this price range- like, battery level indicators.- Highs are okay. There's no tinny feeling in the highs, but they aren't great.OVERALL:These are great earbuds for the price if you like the thought of having truly wireless buds but don't want to shell out the exorbitant prices from the well-known brands like JBL, Senheiser, etc.","So, I had tempered my expectations from this pair of earbuds mainly due to the price.

Seems Nice on look it's Red Colour I bought Colour is on darkest tone side not on brightest as shown on reference pic and that's Good. When I used continuously it did last for 2.5 hrs or 2 hrs . Left earbud for nearby 3 hrs on 70 percent volume. Sound is good bass can be controlled if you have any bass booster app installed. I bought the earbud thinking it would last for 3 hrs or more than it as described on advertisement the Pro version has 5 hrs but it's a big drawback . We can charge it again but powerbank doesn't have enough power to last more than 2 days ( i used for listening music for 3 times a day in that) . Also on listening on one earbud you have to pair the both earbud to mobile you can't pair one earbud. Mistake can be seen I used one earbud after charge down . Try to use another don't know why it wasn't paired then I again put in box and after opening box try pairing it paired. Also the range of Bluetooth is 3 to 5 metres only.You can't return back only replacement option is there that's too bad. Anyway it's still good. But if you have a budget of nearby 4000 recommend to prefer jbl even if it is button version not touch. You can buy if it's below 3000,Seems Nice on look it's Red Colour I bought Colour is on darkest tone side not on brightest as shown on reference pic and that's Good.

"So many glitches. Choppy connectivity with phone. Can only be used for taking calls. Stopped working after 2 weeks. Buying boat products is penny wise pound foolish, as inorder to save some bucs people end up buying low quality earphone like boat. They are nit only cheap quality but also the fit is terrible. Keeps on slipping from ears. I had to throw them in dustbin they are so bad and this poor quality is so consistent with any boat product.","So many glitches. Choppy connectivity with phone.

The best wireless buds out in this proce range. Got it for 2.5k rs and it is worth every penny. The bass is just terrific!! Highs mids and lows are just in place.Just a little issue of the synch time lag of maybe 0.5 sec.The mobile touch clicks can be heard only after that tiny time lag. Everything else is just top notch at this price.Stays in the ear even if we try to bounce it off the ear.  Best option for workouts and cardio sessions.Loved it.

"When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441. Didn't want to invest a lot of money hence gone for it. I purchased it for 2499 and within days - now it s priced at 1799.If you're looking for using these while working out - please don't. These get out of the ear very easily and you won't be able to use them. Forget running, these cannot be used even for basic home workout. Non-Stickiness into the ear is a huge issue with these.After using it for 2 months left ear bud stopped working so I had complained on there website after which they replaced it but in the 2nd set that they sent the same issue arised after a month now they are not even accepting the complaint even though it is in warranty period.Sound quality is okayish and please don't except something spectacular. Bass is not apt.Overall a much hyped product - and boAt has spent way too much on advertising, focusing less on the quality. I won't be buying any other product given the experience I had with these.Not worth even for 2499 - Maximum price for these should have been 999.","When I had to buy wireless earpods, I gone through some blogs here and there and did some small research & finally landed on boAt Airdopes 441.

"I dedicated this unit to my iPhone1. Design and the whole unit's look and feel is awesome - despite it is mentioned as china made... hope my next buy of this bluetooth device will be out of ATMANIRBHAR2. I extensively use it under wifi and also under jio data, and it has been performing so well3. As an avid marathoner, I wanted to check its USER VALUE by means of (1) comfort wearing on ears, (2) audio quality and noise cancellations as I will be running out on road with traffic noises do affect this aspect (3) BATTERY LIFE, (4) MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS NOT FALLING OFF FROM EARS DUE TO JERK IN MY RUNNING MOVEMENTS AND (5) FINALLY, its durability to fight sweat on ears and also in rain conditions, as I ran within my building in the last three days in rain wearing it JUST TO CHECK ITS IXP7 CERTIFICATION THEY ADVERTISED ON THIS PRODUCT.... IT HAS PASSED ALL MY TESTS4. Hence, it is worth buying THOUGH THE PRICE could definitely be just around Rs.2000 and not above... Amazon should think on this factor as well as BoAt as well.","I dedicated this unit to my iPhone1.

"Everything is good about this product but the main problem is that is disconnect automatically and sometimes it works instally after keeping back in the pod and taking out and sometimes takes like a whole day to start again, I messed up all my official conference call after using this product . i shall not recommend this product to anyone, also the exchange days are so less that untill u realise that the problem is with ur product, the exchange days are closed. My bad i bought this for my brother too . Not worth your money .","Everything is good about this product but the main problem is that is disconnect automatically and sometimes it works instally after keeping back in the pod and taking out and sometimes takes like a whole day to start again, I messed up all my official conference call after using this product . i shall not recommend this product to anyone, also the exchange days are so less that untill u realise that the problem is with ur product, the exchange days are closed.

"Most worthy thing about this earphone is that your soñg remains to you only and public don't enjoy it(or even laugh on it) as on even 70-75% volume, nobody is going to listen your song at all. Noise cancellation is top quality.You may experience some pain in your ears during initial days but that'll go away with regular usage. Build quality is good and touch feature works as magic.Comes with a one year warranty so it's really a loot deal in this price range.Update- Gifted it to three friends and they all are loving it.","Most worthy thing about this earphone is that your soñg remains to you only and public don't enjoy it(or even laugh on it) as on even 70-75% volume, nobody is going to listen your song at all.

"For the price, these earphones make a great choice for anybody on the market for TWS. I've known boat for pretty good sound quality (consumer grade) and really punchy bass, and this offers that very well. The battery backup is decent, and these look pretty good too, and sit almost flush with the ear. No protrusion whatsoever. The fit is amazing, and they just don't come off no matter how much I try to shake them off.Definitely would recommend this in the given price range","For the price, these earphones make a great choice for anybody on the market for TWS.

"I ordered a pair of Airdopes in blue colour to match my phone and laptop and they arrived in a proper sealed package and in less than 24 hours at my doorstep. It comes with an instruction manual on how the touch feature works etc. The quality of sound is pretty good as well and I mostly got it for my gymming and gaming so that I do not have to worry about any wires. It's also useful for people who are listening to audio books or college lectures so that they can keep the phone at a distance and do their work by listening side by side. The waterproof feature means your sweat or rain will not affect the sound quality which is useful esp for sports purposes. The light up feature is great for locating the Airdopes in the dark which was useful for my gaming. And I'm able to listen wireless with hands free convinience. The range of the bluetooth connection is really good too! It also came with a charging case and a USB cable for charging. This product is probably the best purchase I have made so far and I'm really happy with it!.Few ways the product can be improved: Many a times when I pair it to a different device, only one of the earplugs work. And the other one doesnt. So I have to put it back into the charger again and then again take it out. I would suggest that there should be a button only for mono mode to prevent it from randomly connecting to only one earplug. But thats just a suggestion I have. Also the USB cord is really small. I think it should be a little bit longer, but I can connect my type C phone cord too it as well. Rest I am happy with my purchase. Thank you :]","I ordered a pair of Airdopes in blue colour to match my phone and laptop and they arrived in a proper sealed package and in less than 24 hours at my doorstep.

"Choosing boAt Airdopes 441 over another brand came down to affordability, and durability. Sure there are much more expensive, and cheaper earbuds, but being spoilt for choice, the boAt Airdopes 441 met my needs. Many prospective buyers who are curious about the origins of the boAt brand? The boAt Airdopes is an Indian consumer electronics brand company who manufacture a fantastic product. For some readers, this review could be long, please bear with me.The reason I bought these earbuds was primarily for hands-free phone conversations with family and friends - giving me the freedom to move away from the handset. The distance of 10 meters mentioned on the instruction manual should be sufficient for most users, provided there are no physical barriers such as walls, doors, and other interference between the Bluetooth signal and the handset. For me, the boat 441 earbuds performed well up to a distance of about 6 meters. But, because of walls between the earbuds and the handset, the calls dropped, and then reconnected once I moved closer to the handset. Without obstructions, the Bluetooth signal should travel the distance of 10 meters comfortably as mentioned in the instruction manual.The instructions in the manual are straightforward and easy to follow. The boAt Airdopes 441 can be used individually, or together for TWS (True Wireless Stereo) listening - perfect for my needs. And besides, if the need arose the earbuds can be factory reset due to malfunctioning, not paring with the handset, or in general, problems with connectivity. The 70-hour (2 hours short of 3 days), standby for the earbuds when in its cradle lets you take it with you when on the move – excellent.What about sound? Well, the 6mm drivers on the earbuds are excellent. There’s lot of bass for bass-heads out there. Considering, prior to buying the earbuds, I rarely listened to music on the handset; now the earbuds are getting a workout. A word of advice - the sound quality could get addictive.The short charging time is excellent for the casual user like myself. I did drain the charging case unknowingly, and when I plugged the case back in, I noticed a mauve / red circle around the blue pulsating light to inform me the charging case is completely, or close to being drained of its charge. Once it begins to charge, the mauve / red circle disappears, while the blue light continues to pulsate. And when the case and the earbuds are fully charged, the pulsating blue light returns to a steady blue. The only downside to the charging experience was the rather short charging cord.The other nice attribute about the boAt 441 Airdopes are they connect using IWP (Insta Wake N’ Pair) technology with your handset. That’s after the earbuds have been paired with the handset. The touch controls are sensitive to either end, or begin a call, or music track. The one option the earbuds don’t have is volume control; it’s got to be done on the handset.I’ve had the boAt 441 Airdopes now for over a month, had a couple of hiccups, which were eventually ironed out. With proper care and handling, hope to get descent miles in the coming years. Incidentally, if you don’t hear any sound in your earbuds? Check if they are paired correctly with the handset, and powered up – fully charged.Lastly, the boAt 441 Airdopes is an excellent pair of earbuds, which deserves 5 stars!Hope this review was helpful.","Choosing boAt Airdopes 441 over another brand came down to affordability, and durability.

Let me start the review by pros of the product:1. Light weight2. Sleek looking3. Excellent bluetooth connectivity4. Good sound quality5. Easy to use touch function6. Value for money7. Good for calling8. Connectivity good till 15m or so .....even if u have a wall in between.9. Excellent battery backup. I used it for 3.5h straight with one charge.10. Amazing fit and design.Specially for ppl with small ears....like me!Cons:1. Volume is not very high2. Touch pad is overly sensitive make it's use irritating sometimes3. I use spotify for music. Even If i close spotify app in my phone properly...accidental touch on the airdopes starts the music again. You will have to close the bluetooth itself to avoid that from happening. It becomes quite irritating at times. Now if u switch off bluetooth again and again....then you might have to pair the airdopes again too since one of the airdopes looses connectivity.4. While calling u will experience a disturbance on and off.....u might have to disconnect and connect again to avoid that.Overall it is a very good buy if u get it for around 2k,Let me start the review by pros of the product:1.

"Excellent for the price. Extremely easy to pair. No problem with the sound quality. It works well on calls as well. I would say it works as well as Apple AirPods. I was extremely apprehensive about this product after reading the problems about the noise in the left ear but there is none,  no connectivity issue with the Bluetooth. Those who wrote about it must have got a defective piece. The most important thing to do is to choose the correct size of the rubber bud which goes into the ear. I am extremely happy with it...","Excellent for the price. Extremely easy to pair. No problem with the sound quality. It works well on calls as well. I would say it works as well as Apple AirPods.

"Alright, I have been using this product for a month now and I have to say the buy was worth it.• Boat lived up to its name and delivered a marvellous sound quality: (4/5). To give you a better idea, let me give you an example: I am able to hear the harmonics and adlibs of every song I listen to just as clearly as the main vocals. It's thAt clear.• As for the bass: (3.5/5), yup, it's good, although if you're someone who listens to metal music would not find it satisfactory. Other than than, the bass is awesome for the other music genres.• Noise cancellation: (3/5), I'm not saying it'll shut you off from the world BUT I'm also nOt saying Airdopes' noise cancellation will be unable to filter the background disturbances. It can. And it does it well. I was satisfied with the NC'n for a product bought at this price range.• The touch controls work wonderfully. They're easy to understand. To be able to control your media with touch rather than having to search for and push buttons happened to be a primitive job well designed and I am hence very happy with the easy controls.Overall this product is very satisfactory for this price. While you can't expect to have the quality of a premium model such as Bose, you sure can expect it to be the toughest competition in the mid range models.My only complaint with Airdopes is that I can't alter the volume as there is simply no option for it. But given that I most have my phone in my pocket I don't think this little problem is not much to not buy this product.So if you're thinking of buying it, go for it.","Alright, I have been using this product for a month now and I have to say the buy was worth it.• Boat lived up to its name and delivered a marvellous sound quality: (4/5).

It can. And it does it well. I was satisfied with the NC'n for a product bought at this price range.• The touch controls work wonderfully. They're easy to understand. To be able to control your media with touch rather than having to search for and push buttons happened to be a primitive job well designed and I am hence very happy with the easy controls.Overall this product is very satisfactory for this price. While you can't expect to have the quality of a premium model such as Bose, you sure can expect it to be the toughest competition in the mid range models.My only complaint with Airdopes is that I can't alter the volume as there is simply no option for it. But given that I most have my phone in my pocket I don't think this little problem is not much to not buy this product.So if you're thinking of buying it, go for it.",alright I use product month I say buy worth boat live name deliver marvellous sound quality give well idea let I give example I able hear harmonic adlibs every song I listen clearly main vocal clear bass yup good although someone listen metal music would not find satisfactory bass awesome music genre noise cancellation I not say shut world I also not say airdope noise cancellation unable filter background disturbance well I satisfied ncn product buy price range touch control work wonderfully easy understand able control medium touch rather search push button happen primitive job well design I hence happy easy controls overall product satisfactory price not expect quality premium model bose sure expect tough competition mid range models complaint airdope I not alter volume simply no option give I phone pocket I not think little problem not much not buy product think buy go

"Good for occasional music listeners, but has severe limitations. Specially if you’re an iOS or Mac user, not at all recommended. These days everyone uses 2 devices, but it only connects one device at a time and even if you disconnect one and try to connect 2nd one, it prompts you to forget and repair the 2nd device. And when you go back to the first device, same thing happens. Not at all great experience if you’re using 2 devices. On positive note, battery back up and Bluetooth connectivity is great. Sound quality when it comes to output is above avg, but when it comes to phone calls or attending meetings over zoom, you don’t have good experience.Bottom line is One Should only buy this if they have single device and need the earbud only to listen to music!","Good for occasional music listeners, but has severe limitations.

"I liked the look of it, how it is made, the box , lights everything looks very nice and cool. Unfortunately headphones are not meant be a showpiece. It should produce nice sound for the money you pay. This is where this product failes miserably.  Horrible sound quality, I could not believe 2.5k worth gear will sound so horrible, so exchanged it for new one. Again sound remained same. If your goal is to look nice by wearing these, then definitely you should buy this.If you are looking decent sound quality stay miles away from it. All those reviews on YouTube and amazon they may not what is better sounding headphone. JBL, Marshall are benchmark at this price range. It will be grave sin on my part to compare this headphone with that of JBL / Marshall. 300rs Philips neckband headphone sounds  way better than this (Philips neckband headphone is extremely good at that price)","I liked the look of it, how it is made, the box , lights everything looks very nice and cool.

"Pros:1. At this price point, its much better than the competition.2. The only ear buds with a small silicone/rubber wing. It helps in keeping the bud in place even during work outs. The only time it pops out is if you bend down.3. The fit and finish of the buds and the storage case is decent. Size+ weight of the buds is perfect. The box is also small enough to be carried in your pocket.4. Very bass heavy sound stage. For most indian users, this will be a good thing.Cons:1. IWP sometimes fails. Just pop ear buds back in box and close. Open and try again.2. Touch control on the buds also sometimes fails. But again a simple reset solves the problem. (Ive noticed the failure only when my phone is connected to my amazfit watch also. And my watch also has music control, i suspect that could be the reason).3. The noise cancellation is purely by virtue of the snug fit of the ear buds. Similar to a passive noise cancellation.4. The microphone is decent, but picks up a lot of ambient noise. So a call in a public place will be a problem for the person you talk to.(multiple callers i spoke to mentioned too much background voices etc).5. Finally the sound stage/profile being too bass centric. Most songs can get by, but sometimes the bass just over powers everything else. Some tweaking of the equaliser may help.Verdict: would recommmend it for casual music listening. And for people who need music while they exercise. At this price point, im happy with my purchase.","Pros:1. At this price point, its much better than the competition.2. The only ear buds with a small silicone/rubber wing.

This product is not worth a penny. I have been using it and it is not good in any aspect. I have purchased a 50 rs wired earphones and they work better than this. In the name of noise cancellation it will cancel your own voice but it will definitely amplify your background noise. The person who you are calling won't be able to hear u clearly. You'll end up holding one earbud near your mouth for them to be able to hear you.Now talking about music. Literally every other earbud will give you same voice. Don't fall for thumping bass marketing. Invest your money somewhere else.Also one more thing to note. It really slips from ears fast.,This product is not worth a penny.

"If you are a bass lover then go  for it, bass is not overwhelming but punchy and maintain highs and mids properly with bass on higher side and thats how I like it.Noise cancellation is superb but this great ability restricts you from wearing them while walking on roads.Looks great, fit is a subjective isssue which can be adjusted and one you get the best fit you will make the most out of this TWS.Battery is one of the most impressing things of this device which lasts around 1 week if you are using it for 4 hours a day. Boat airdopes 441 pro is not worth as that one is quite bulky and too much of battery backup is just of no use as this one is providing more than enough.Charging case is sturdy feels premium in hands and small enough to be unnoticable when you carry the aroundCall experince was nice good when environment is quiet but in noisy conditions it works just fine for other side to be able to hear but can hear the noises too.There is absolutely no connectivity issue with them and comes with touch control with very good response and gestures provided on them.You can get them around ₹2000 in any electronics sale which make it worth for money 💰.If you have a budget around 2k then these are best for you. If there is any reason I will not recommended them is if you have better budget or you want superior call quality.Rest if you are looking to have a complete tws with spending less and saving more there is no reason you should spend more.","If you are a bass lover then go  for it, bass is not overwhelming but punchy and maintain highs and mids properly with bass on higher side and thats how I like it.Noise cancellation is superb but this great ability restricts you from wearing them while walking on roads.Looks great, fit is a subjective isssue which can be adjusted and one you get the best fit you will make the most out of this TWS.Battery is one of the most impressing things of this device which lasts around 1 week if you are using it for 4 hours a day.

"It is really a great product I got it for ₹1999 on sale. The bass effect is amazing and battery back up is just superb.Cons :Main drawback  is the touch is very sensitive so even a slight touch of your hand while adjusting the bud in your ear would cause the music to stop.CAN’T  use this while you are sleeping or laying side ways on your pillow - if you are person who listens to music while you sleep then you are in for a nightmare . You simply can’t use this as the touch to the pillow just turns off your earphones.Touch doesn’t just work with your hands it works with any dress material , gloves , pillows .... you name any surface it will be able to operate your earphones","It is really a great product I got it for ₹1999 on sale.

"I have been using this from last 3 months and here is my opinion:Pros-1. Fits perfectly in ears with or without the ear hook.2. Bass quality is very good as per my experience.3. Boat claims 25 hours of total playback and yes they are right because I got a battery backup of total 22 to 23 hours with the case at average or medium volume and almost 17 to 18 hours of total backup at full volume.4. I found the noise cancelation very good especially in this price range.5. You get 2 years warranty with the product which no other company provides you in this price range.6. Easy to hold the case in hand, very sleek design.Cons-1. If you are using it for long sessions with or without the ear hook your ears may start paining because i have experienced it as they pain very much if you remove them after 2 or 3 hrs using.2. Plastic body case which might disappoint you.Overall a good product specially in 2k with good audio quality, bass, noise cancelation, fitting, etc. If you want a TWS in this price range from a trust worthy brand go for it.👍","I have been using this from last 3 months and here is my opinion:Pros-1.

"Pros:-Brilliant packaging-Damn impressive Led lights on Earbuds making them very attractive-Flawless connectivity with no apparent master-servant earbud visibility, therefore I can easily use one earbud at a time without losing connectivity.-Decent bass, nothing too overpowering.Cons-unlike old boat earphones I have (wired 225) these didn't have two sets of earbuds, which is all the more important because tws have special kind of buds which are hard to find. Plus, unlike them, this did not have a resealable packet, therefore once you open it, you gotta keep it somewhere else.- horrible lag for a bluetooth 5 earphone. Almost 1+ second lag. Moreover, it has a visible .5 second delay sometimes even for movies on netflix which generally sync the audio delay on bluetooth devices to make up for delayed lag. I'm not sure why it's there but it is.- though we all knew the calling wouldn't be clear in a tws, I tried using one piece near my mouth for easier clarity, but the super sensitive taps end up cutting the call instead, I wish we had an option to disable one tap cutting call on tws.- person issue- i find the connecting sound to be rather spookyDespite the nitpicking cons, I really like it.

"I had boat rockerz 510 ON EAR headphones & that gave me the impression that these particular Boat Airdope 441 may be  good but Honestly it doesnt. First, the airdope's Ear bud are kind of circular Cone shaped & that itself pushes out the Airdope away from ear & hence falls out easily! Second the Boat Earfins ie on side a small projected guard kind to prevent from fallout, that also doesnt seem to serve purpose! Inside 2 Airfins- Long Airfin, SHort Airfin provided. The problem is Long Airfin is a pain on the ears, neither provided grip & then short Airfin is kind of too small & dont serve either. PERHAPS THE DESIGN IS NOT MADE FOR ALL EARS, IN MY CASE IF I DO A LITTLE BIT OF JUMPING OR EXERCISE THE AIRDOPES FELL OUT EASILY SO WHATS THE USE?? Secondly The SOUND QUALITY is below Average, The BASE is OVER AMPLIFIED and the TREBBLE/Voices are not crystal clear enough and in High Volume you will only hear BASE and voice in music will be negligible. So it didnt leave upto the expectation. And Voice call is mostly unheard on the otherside. I would say the product is or may be good for NEW CUSTOMERS who just recently bought a wireless piece for the First Time but its not good for Experience customers like those who had Boat Rockers 510 as these 510 has awesome bass and awesome voice clarity in music, only downfall is bulky & not fit for voice call","I had boat rockerz 510 ON EAR headphones & that gave me the impression that these particular Boat Airdope 441 may be  good but Honestly it doesnt.

"I purchased these airdopes in October 2020....I don't usually review any purchased items. But these airdopes are like Gopi bahu(and Aquaman)....no matter how bad they've been treated...they work just fine.So I am here.. writing a review after 7 months. Although I like earphones from the time of purchase itself,the connectivity, 8d kind of audio quality, etcBut recently I mistakenly dropped one of the airdope(Aquaman) in water and it stayed there immersed for 3 days .....on the fourth day when I found it .....I was sure it wouldn't work ...but by the time I splashed water on in....the LED started blinking red🙂......i thought to myself....that it's just the LED.....then it got connected with my phone..flawlessly....played music... flawlessly.....I was amazed. Only recently I found that the speaker is not working while I am on a call. I am totally fine with it.Now comes the miraculous escape of the other airdope....I ""accidentally""( I am very careful most of the times 🙂).....put the other airdope on top of the mixer grinder....the place where the jar fixes with the body(who does that?... I did)....and my equally carefully mom carefully fixed the jar with airdope beneath it. Next comes the sound of stones being ground.....but the jar had peanuts inside....that is when it hit me.I rushed and removed the jar. There it was.... innocently blinking red at me...I saw Gopi vaww in that moment. This time too I was sure that It wouldn't work , so I threw it in a shelf. But...you guessed it right....after 4 days today...when I finally freed myself from the claws of idling...I tried pairing it and IT IS WORKING TOTALLY FINE, without any issues whatsoever. Seriously, why?? Why tolerate so much?Hope my short review would pursuade you enough that you start dreaming about it....until you finally decide to buy it.","I purchased these airdopes in October 2020....I don't usually review any purchased items.

"Hey there!So, I just received my pair of Boat Airdopes 441 and as you can see in the pictures, it is in yellow and it's perfectly splendid! 😁I like the design a lot. The fit is snug and comfortable to my ears (two pairs of extra eartips are provided, so use what fits you). The average size tips fit me well and the fins help to secure it in your ears. It doesn't fall off even when working out. I need to check it with jump rope though.The bass is punchy and the various sounds are clear to my ears at medium volume.There is a kind of passive noise cancellation due to the in-ear design and it works a bit.Don't know about the battery life. Later, I might give an edit to this section after using it.The only thing I found a bit odd was that whenever I press pause/play, the music does not stop instantly. It takes about a second to stop.The packaging by Amazon was good.I got it for a mere ₹1600 and a tws at this price point, it's a steal!I suggest that you go for it! 👍Cheers!","Hey there!So, I just received my pair of Boat Airdopes 441 and as you can see in the pictures, it is in yellow and it's perfectly splendid! 😁I like the design a lot.

"Sound quality is good but the feature of noise cancellation works in wrong way. I used it with all types of software, Zoom, GoogleMeet, etc. The noise cancellation features auto disconnects and connects earphones all the time. I cannot connect my earphones when I am in meeting, it just sucks. Tried to search on google and I have applied almost all the workaround by updating zoom, updating Google Meet, checking on option of dont want noise cancellation everything. The problem is with earphones, they keep on connecting and disconnecting again and again.Use it only if you want to listen to music. If you want to join meetings then this product is not worth it.","Sound quality is good but the feature of noise cancellation works in wrong way.

"After a lot of brain storming, I decided to go with Boat Airdopes 441.

"Its a good product, my piece has a little static that is noticeable when nothing is playing, but when the music starts to play the bass takes over and you realize how well made these small piece of earphones are. They are pretty cheap and really worth the money, the battery life could be better but the case makes up for it. The bass is good the treble is a little too much at high volumes but these aren't bose headsets so don't expect studio level sound quality from them.  If you are looking for eveyday headsets that are wireless go for them you can't go wrong with boat. Made in china tho, if that is an issue for you then think is over, but to make you feel better i can only say that they definately don't feel like a made in china product.","Its a good product, my piece has a little static that is noticeable when nothing is playing, but when the music starts to play the bass takes over and you realize how well made these small piece of earphones are.

"Amazing product. Worth buying. I already had wireless neck band. Still purchased this product. Very happy to have it. Connectivity is the best. Connects quickly without any disturbance on calls.Very comfortable and convenient. You can use one pod at a time while on calls (increases standby time of other pod). Also, it charges on its own. Very Good battery life. The touch sometimes is annoying, as the call drops when you touch the pod by mistake. Otherwise, it is an awesome product for both calls and listing to audio.","Amazing product. Worth buying. I already had wireless neck band. Still purchased this product. Very happy to have it.

"As expected, in this price tag, one should not expect too much of the sound quality, the most important aspect of an audio device. Earbuds are great piece of engineering designed to be short lived, and this sophistication should come at a price. However, an ultra competitive market for these has created a mushroom growth of fancy looking earbuds, with minimal focus of the most important aspect: The Sound. No complaints however, we asked for these. Boats Airdopes 441 is no exception. To summarise my observations, with a bias towards the less said points are as follows:1. The product comes in attractive package. However, don't get swayed by it. If you notice with Sherlockian eye, you soon start finding the issues. The package has silly grammatical errors and style mismatch. For example, look at the bottom most line. What does it say?""This can done using the volume control on your bluetooth device...""A little above you will find ""Charging norms & Precautionary Guidelines"".Now take out the nice little box and turn over. 'Earbuds' battery' but 'Charging Box Battery' (see the image attached).Does it really matter? Yes. It reflects a company's care towards maintaining the brand image (Remember, what happened to Micromax?). It is particularly a shame, because India is a major English speaking country and their tag "" MADE IN INDIA BY AN INDIAN BRAND"" really doesn't go as per with these mistakes which arise from a careless  person who didn't have Grammerly installed in PC. Is it a deal breaker? No.2. Inside the box you will find a bunch of useless papers with photos of 'celebrities' claiming to use Boats and also a sticker for no reason. The charging case, however is attractive and well designed with a USB-C port. The case is not operable with one hand though, you need both.3. After opening, the experience was more or less smooth. Just after opening this Pandora's box, you will notice alternative green and blue lights flashing on the touch control, suggesting they are paired. Pairing is an ease, with little manual effort, particularly with an Android phone. Soon one earbud stops flashing, only one does inside the box, but they remain paired. Don't mistake it as a problem.4. As I said, Boat focused so much into the package and design, they probably forgot the most important thing: the sound quality. The little buddies are bass heavy, which means they will be really bad for instrument separation or high frequency music. As far as my testing goes, for calling and listening to audio stories, they work just okay.5. One good point is however it's waterproofing rating. It is IPX7 rated, unlike most of its competitors, which come with either IP4 or IP5 rating. Now, I haven't tested the waterproofing myself, but for heavy exercise, this works more or less fine. Not perfect, because I have experienced frequent disconnection between two buds, which can be restored by putting them into the case.So that's a list of my observations frequently not discussed. If you are fine with average sound, and with a budget, this can do the job. After all, number of reviews in any platform will tell you that these are extensively tested by a lot of people. And that is not without reasons.","As expected, in this price tag, one should not expect too much of the sound quality, the most important aspect of an audio device.

Hii guys!... I am writing a review because i was also reading reviews before buy the airdops... So I am using the airdopes for last 2-3 days. Sound quality is awesome. Battery life is exactly as mentioned in the descriptions. It also shows a battery sign on your phone like this🔋. Delivery is real fast thank to Amazon for that. Calling experience is really good. There is no noise from both the sides during the call. There is no automatically disconnection of calls. Connectivity is the best thing. Airdops connect to your phone as soon as you pick them out of the case after first time pairing process. Charging is really fast. Airdops fits in the ear very smoothly and comfortably.Is prize m yeh ek dm badiya product h yrrr m bhi aap hi k jese review pdh kr liya the inko to socha ki m bhi aane walo ki help kr doon review dekr to is liye kr diya.

This noise continues for about 7-8 seconds after the music stops.It becomes quite irittating to use the earphones with that noise in the background.Read about same problem with other customers too.,The left earphone makes a noise with the start of music.

"I don't know how amazon gets profit when they lower the price to more than half of the original price. Its audio quality is quite good, the bass is so overfilling. There seemed to be a slight problem in the connectivity which when you keep the buds in the case and close it after use, it sometimes doesn't disconnect automatically. You'll have to reopen the box and close it again to make it disconnect. But this happens rarely and it is not that big of a deal. Other than this, there is no problem in the connectivity and audio. As this is the best seller for so long, I would think that if they make it a Bluetooth version of 5.1 or 5.2, it would be great. No other problems. I would suggest everyone to get this item in amazon on a deal as it lowers the price drastically. I loved this product.","I don't know how amazon gets profit when they lower the price to more than half of the original price. Its audio quality is quite good, the bass is so overfilling.

Been using this for last 3 months. The sound quality is no doubt excellent but i paide 2400 not just for sound quality but also for the charging time.Both the ear buds are dead in 4 hours average and the power bank is only good for like 10-11 charges only. So in total like 45-50 hours of battery life in one charge. Even 800-900 rs earbuds can perform the same way. So its no value for money. And the power bank function for mobile I rarely use since phone chargers are way better option(fast charging and all) and it only charges like 40% of my 4400 mah battery. The connectivity is good most of times (8/10) and the mic does it's job. The touch works perfectly as wellVery good asthetics and great sound quality. Good warranty support.Go for other brand as 441(cheaper alternative) have lots of connectivity issues. But if battery life doesn't concern you much or you are okay to pay 1200 more for battery performance same as 800-900 ones provide go for this.,Been using this for last 3 months.

"Giving a rating of 5 for the very reason that the overall quality of the product is in accordance to its price i.e. if you expect more you need to pay more.Pros:Good Design of the case and the earbudsGood Battery life of case and earbudsComfort - amazing. No adjustment required. I just place them in my ears and forget them.Good connectivity protocol. Just open the case and it gets connected and just put them back in the case and close it to off then / charge them. Pleasant. isn't it.Sound quality is between excellent and good.Cons:While listening to music, at times we notice momentary blank sound pockets in either of the earThe sensitivity of the touchpads is not so goodWhen playing a video; there is always a lag of around 100 microseconds between the video and audio you hear through these earbuds. Maybe Bluetooth Technology works that way.Calling experience:While using it for a call; audio keeps cracking for the listener on the other side. No issues on our side.Also, for wired earphones where-in we have the mic in front of our mouth it works efficiently. While for any earbud we always have the mic (in ears) behind the audio source (our mouth) and because of this mic needs to be extra strong to catch the forward projecting sound. This strength of the mic proves to be a big weakness for it - it also captures ambient sound with high intensity and makes it noisy for the listener on the other side. This may be a problem for every earbud however, the one with a higher price may have a solution to this issue.","Giving a rating of 5 for the very reason that the overall quality of the product is in accordance to its price i.e. if you expect more you need to pay more.Pros:Good Design of the case and the earbudsGood Battery life of case and earbudsComfort - amazing.

"Yes u have done it yet again boat... Honest 1st day review.... To start with Delivery it was a bit late may b cuz of the current scenario... Bt to tell u guys these airdopes are the real beast in all the departments. Talking about the sound quality it is really nice, one can compare its sound quality with the good wired earphones available in the market, awesome punchy bass.. Vocals and treble were also quide good.  Built quality is way far better as compare to any other eatbuds in this price bracket but one thing the charging case is a bit slippery so be careful guys. Talking abt the battery backup guys i have not streached it for long as have used the airdopes for an hr or so and battery only droped 20% from 100 to 80 ( of airdopes not the charging case) , so in terms of battery i assume that i will give me decent battery backup of 3 to 4 hrs with approx 3 to 4 charging cycles of a fully charged charging case. I am just loving it :)Just go for it without a second thought !","Yes u have done it yet again boat... Honest 1st day review....

"I bought this after having one plus bluetooth earphone. I regret not having checked all the features. it lacks lot of things as below1) Auto connecting to multiple devices :  first of all in my one plus you have feature to shift automatically between one device to other, which is not here, after using this in one plus i feel it must. here you have to disconnect from one device and then connect in another device. it is said that it will always pair automatically with last device every time you open. but i see it not getting connected at times and manually I have to select.2) Touch controls :  these are super sensitive and annoying still after 1 month not able to understand what is the use. the only thing is that call gets disconnected immediately if you accidently touch it to adjust in your ears. for video/music playing it stop on touch3) No volume up or down feature in touch controls :  you have to do manually in the device only which you have connected4) Don't use for calling outdoor : This is the most pathetic part. outdoor you can use only for music/videos etc. if you are doing calling, the other guy can't hear you at all or will hear very weak voice from your end. infact the first piece that i ordered had issue in indoor calling etc as inbetween I was not able to hear anything from other caller, Also while having bluetooth connectivity on google meet/team meeting thru laptop it was failing, thankfully i replaced it immediately and atleast this new piece is not giving that much problem. however i am not using it regularly as one plus is much better and convienientEar fitment : these are quite big and does not fit well. i took it for my wife but she but these do not fit well, there are no additional ear pads given also.All in all this is not what i paid for. since there is no return option I have to keep it and regret","I bought this after having one plus bluetooth earphone.

"This is a review after 6 months of first purchase. I purchased my first pair of these earphones in December 2020.My first pair of earphones, unfortunately, got left in my pants and went through an entire wash cycle in the machine before being recovered.The interesting part is that even after being harshly spun and thrashed in soap water for over 15 minutes, the charging box and one of the earphones still work (without the touch which was basically the only drawback that my wife encountered and now they are perfect for her).Which is why I went for another one in March 2021.My second pair had a mild charging issue, so BOAT replaced the set for me and the new ones are working great!Coming to the pros and cons.PROS:1. Ridiculously sturdy and long lasting2. Good price3. Battery life is really good (on full charge, you can easily use these for days)4. Water and sweat resistance is excellent5. BOAT customer care is very good6. I use these for my workouts and they stay in place even while joggingCONS:1. The touch sensitivity is quite high so you may inadvertently press the earphones sometimes without intending to, but you get used to it fairly soon2.

It works well. The dock is magnetised so that one can never put the pods in the wrong direction. The voice is loud and clear and the microphone also seems to work fine. Haven't tested it in noisy conditions so cannot vouch for the performance under extreme circumstances. Nevertheless works well when being used while cooking in the kitchen :-).The battery lasts long enough and it appears to stretch further as one tends to put it back in the pod receptacle for the fear of losing it. :-).Nice wireless in the ear pods.,It works well.

"Let me state the positives firstSound quality is as per what you'd expect in this price range...Now the issue that made me give this a 1 star...Battery life is pathetic..I've always used both the earbud together, never used only one at a time.Within the first week, my right earbud started running out of the battery about 15 minutes before the left one. So the right one will switch off and the left one will go on for about 15 minutes more. I didn't think too much of it and used to put the buds back on charging once the right went out of battery.  BIG MISTAKE I should have returned them in 1st week itself.At this point right one used to last between 3.5 to 4 hours, and left one would last 15 - 20 minutes more if I continued using it.The time right lasted kept on decreasing and the time gap between how long right lasted and left lasted kept on increasing.And now about 8 months later it has come to a point where the right ones do not last more than 30 minutes!!!So I can't use my earbuds for more than 30 mins...I don't know how long the left lasts now if I continue using it because I've completely stopped using my earbuds. What's the point of only being able to use it for 30 minutes, as soon as I start using I just keep wondering when is it gonna say ""battery low""I find these earbuds a complete waste of money","Let me state the positives firstSound quality is as per what you'd expect in this price range...Now the issue that made me give this a 1 star...Battery life is pathetic..I've always used both the earbud together, never used only one at a time.Within the first week, my right earbud started running out of the battery about 15 minutes before the left one.

What's the point of only being able to use it for 30 minutes, as soon as I start using I just keep wondering when is it gonna say ""battery low""I find these earbuds a complete waste of money",let I state positive firstsound quality per would expect price range issue make I give star battery life pathetic ive always use earbud together never use one time within first week right earbud start run battery minute left one right one switch left one go minute I not think much use put bud back charge right go battery big mistake I return st week point right one use last hour leave one would last minute I continue use time right last keep decrease time gap long right last leave last keep increasing month later come point right one not last minutesso I not use earbud min I not know long left last I continue use I completely stop use earbud point able use minute soon I start use I keep wonder go say battery lowi find earbud complete waste money

"First of all it’s not good for long time usage usually none are except airpods as I have been using them too, other than that for basic hour or two usuage it will do the job overall the quality is good but while taking phone calls quality could have been better otherwise for music it’s good for the price. Just wished this colourful lights that glow all the time while changing songs ( only glows at that time or while taking them out of the case ) makes it look cheap personal opinion.","First of all it’s not good for long time usage usually none are except airpods as I have been using them too, other than that for basic hour or two usuage it will do the job overall the quality is good but while taking phone calls quality could have been better otherwise for music it’s good for the price.

"I would simply say, they are best for their price.I literally searched and watched videos and whatnot for a TON of products like this one, in this range.Reviews were there, but I always was sceptical. But then finally bought them for my sister.And happy to say, they are amazing.Just go for it. Don't waste time looking elsewhere.Note: READ THE MANUAL, even if it is boring. Because at times, you would feel that one earbud has stopped working, but it actually has not. It is a feature that allows only one bud to play. So please read the manual even if it may seem boring.My only deduction of 1 start would be for loudness. When I connect to my laptop, it does not get as loud as I would like it to, even at full volume. Could be my own problem, or maybe not.But for that price, and in that range, these are the best. I have recommended them to 4 people, and 3 of them bought them, and they all are happy so far. It has been 6 months or so.","I would simply say, they are best for their price.I literally searched and watched videos and whatnot for a TON of products like this one, in this range.Reviews were there, but I always was sceptical.

"I have tried the bluetooth based headphones (for cordless application) for the first time. But my experience with airdrops from Boat is excellent. The first thing which I felt good was that these fit in very well in our years due to the special rubber extenders present help fit into any ear without being painful. We can easily jog without fear of it popping out of your ears. The battery back up is very good, and the advantage is that the case retains the battery back up for over two weeks if one is using for one hour a day for exercise (which I use). But I am sure if one uses for 3 to four hours a day then it should surely last for over a week before you charge. It is very easy to charge to both directly from power source or from any power bank or phone. Extremely satisfied with sound quality, ease of stop, forward, reverse and play by tapping on the airdrops. Since they fit in very nicely to ear you need to remove one of them to talk to people.","I have tried the bluetooth based headphones (for cordless application) for the first time.

"So i got this airdopes pro in amazon prime sale for 2500/- Rs. So i got an amazing deal.I am very satisfied with this product.Sound quality:-The sound quality of this product is very decent.  Low frequency ( bass ) is  bossted. But i like it. Depends on you. Mids and highs are also decent.In this price range quality for these airdopes are decent.Noise cancellation:- The outer noisw cancellation for person who is hearing is very good. Example, if you wear these properly  outer noise will reduce and you will hear less noise frok outside.But the noise cancellation during call is very bad.When you call someone the other person will here everything so loudly except your voice. Even little outside noise will feel so loud for that person. So if you're only buying these for calling, it is not a good option.Built Quality:-Built Quality for the headphones and the case both are very good. The case is sturdy and good quality.Also when you wear them in ears they fit properly. They don't fall out during exercise. Also they are waterproof so swet won't be a problem.Overall i find these very helpful and good. I am satisfied with these","So i got this airdopes pro in amazon prime sale for 2500/- Rs.

Great fit in my ears and my blue colour earbuds looks awesome. As compared to other Brand, no one brand can beat Boat Airdopes 441 pro.I played pubg also by using them and there is no sound lagg which is very impressive. You should definitely buy it. Its a complete package and gives you worth buying at a price of Rs2500. Finally got something after waiting for so long. Overall no brand can beat them and I loved it, I think everyone would love it after using it.","Worth waiting as I ordered it on 8 August, Freedom sale.

Boat surely knows how to provide customers with absolute value for the buck. The product feels premium. Easily feels like a 4-5k worth tws. It gets a C type charging port now that's something isn't common for tws buds. The sound is absolutely amazing. Yes they're bass oriented bit still overall sound quality is way too good for the price. I got them for 1600 during Diwali sale on Amazon so if your budget is within 2K then go for these without even comparing it to the other products at this price range.,Boat surely knows how to provide customers with absolute value for the buck.

"For the price point, this is amazing.I like bass in my music and the product doesn't fail to deliver on that aspect.

"Okay, so I purchased this after much researching and checking out array of budget and premium earbuds/ pods. Each and everyone of it had mix reviews. I purchased these, with having an experience of great customer service from boat regarding any issues with the device, returns, warranty, etc. The more you search, the lesser options you'll see. I decided to go with this. Initial product was delivered the next day ( hats off to prime delivery) the device had some issue as it didn't disconnected and the call quality had some issues. I initiated a return, got a replacement. Had the same issue. Finally asked for a refund, and purchased another product, same seller just different product. It has been more than a week. Sound is clear, the bass quality is amazing. The call quality to the receiving end is good ( could be great) as it just has 6 mm drivers, nonetheless the quality is really good for 2400/- what I loved it when while working out ( cardio, HIIT and all) the ear buds didn't fall off. And given I was using it throughout the day. The buds are really light too. The touch controls are good as well. Over all it's a really good product.","Okay, so I purchased this after much researching and checking out array of budget and premium earbuds/ pods. Each and everyone of it had mix reviews.

"I have been using these air dopes for about a week now. The dopes are sleek small and fit well into the ear. When on, I only get to hear the music and nothing on. The dopes are responsive, sometimes a little too much as a simple touch can pause / skip / or start new song.The case is good. Only thing to watch out will be to see how long the lids last given the usage.Battery backup is great. I used it 4 hours at a stretch without any issues and atleast 15 hours with one charge of the case. The sound quality is great for the price of the air dopes. Easy to use and beautiful looking too.

Got my earphones before the date.. Thanks amazon for faster delivery. Earlier product it got was defective as its rubber was torn and right piece speaker was not clear at other end. But it was replaced very early. Using this tws for almost one month. I use it mainly for calling purpose. Right piece is good for calling as the person on the other end can hear me clearly but with left piece other side is not that much clear. So boat must provide clarity on both pieces.For music purpose boat is as usual good.Battery backup is good. And case get charge fast.There must be a option to stop blinking of led.

"The product is overall extremely good who want to use it for music and calls both. Music stream delay is hardly noticable but sometimes delay can be observed if you're streaming in HD/4k quality on YouTube or other platform. Calling is really good. I talked to my friend on call in busy streets of Mumbai and he was able to hear me with much noise in the background, so recommended for calling as well. Microphone on this TWS is unbeatable by any other brand in this price range. I have 3 TWS and none of them can beat the sound and mic quality of this one.THE BIGGEST CON:I was talking to my colleague on call while I was walking and suddenly the left earbud ran out of battery and I was only left with one earbud to attend the call which is hard because you hear noise from the other ear. I had to close my ears with my hand to listen. If you intend to call only from house then this is good to go.I think both earphones must run at the same time and must provide equal battery life.","The product is overall extremely good who want to use it for music and calls both. Music stream delay is hardly noticable but sometimes delay can be observed if you're streaming in HD/4k quality on YouTube or other platform. Calling is really good. I talked to my friend on call in busy streets of Mumbai and he was able to hear me with much noise in the background, so recommended for calling as well. Microphone on this TWS is unbeatable by any other brand in this price range.

"Hi I ordered this earphones as I needed to multitask with my kid and taking office calls. The ease of use is great and ear buds fit well. Also the battery life is quite good .. I use it for  almost 2 hours daily and i charge it once in 2-3 days. A couple of changes I would prefer, the end call is super sensitive and one needs to be very careful not to touch earphones when the call is on going else you’ll get dropped off. Also there is no option to mute the call by touching the earphones. This would be super helpful to go completely hands free.","Hi I ordered this earphones as I needed to multitask with my kid and taking office calls. The ease of use is great and ear buds fit well.

I was a bit tensed on reading the reviews before getting the buds on hand. But when I put them on my ears, guys, believe me all my doubts vanished. The sound quality is so great considering the price of the buds.  You guys can blindly go for the buds without any hesitation.But one thing I must say considering the latest price 3499, its a bit overpriced. Thankyou","Sound - 8/10Bass - 9/10Looks awesomeBuild quality GreatBattery backup GoodFeel comfortable in the earsTouch response GreatPairing very fast, once paired the next time it gets connected within a second on opening the boxPersonally I didnt find any noise from the left earbud which many have experienced.Overall a great product at 2499.

I bought in May2021. The product was dysfunctional with in 2weeks of purchase. I raised complaint in the boat website and it was picked up by Bluedart for service. But I didn't receive any communication from Boat later. I tried to contact boat customer care multiple times and could reach after multiple attempts initially. Got excuses from them citing COVID. But no response later. So far I called customer care 10times. Each time only apologies and excuses from them. Not even a single email from them. I sent copy of acknowledgement of Bluedart pickup also. Very apathic and callous response. I literally feel my product is lost.,I bought in May2021.

 It is no doubt a 5 star product.I have had boat products before and as its an Indian based company, I support it a lot. It's all a genuine opinion of mine. I bought boat rockers 400 on-ear headphones and for like 2 years they worked ,were awesome, and I had no issues ever. They still work! I just broke the plastic over head band ,but the electronics still work. It's great value for money.Then I bought this. For this let me say.I was going to buy 441 but kept it in my wishlist but then the pro version came,Nothing different but they added a big battery as a power bank! Simple but great idea. I have them now for 2 months and guess how many times I've charged it? Only once.The product is mind-blowing. I rarely give 5 stars to anyone except when it's Perfect. And it's perfect value for money.There is a rubber part around the earphones, you turn it and dude forget about them falling out. The pairing speed is Virtually nothing. See the video, it's paired. Open it and it pairs in 2 seconds (for device connected before of course) . Of course you can use it as a power bank too , you need a USB to whatever type your phone needs. It's awesome. Sound quality is also great and the range too. Seamless talks on calls clear audio.No doubt it's like 5th largest wearable electronics brand in the world. It's this excellent products they make.I'm proud of this company as an Indian too. Cheers.(One note: you have to take care with the capacitive touch on both the earphones during calls as even at slightest touch, it ends the call, happened with me a lot in the beginning)","The media could not be loaded.

"UPDATE: Sept 21It's been more than a year using these earphones. It's truly worth the price. I use it daily almost 6-7 hours in good time interval, take calls also thru these, these works fine.sound quality and functions are still intact.------------------------Prodyct is really good.Good fit, good playback time of 2-3 hours if continuously used, Good noise cancellation. Very light weight.case is also nice, You dont have to keep it on charging always.Fancy lights on the touch panel really looks good.it's good one in this range.Problem:Touch is very sensitive. By the time you open and try to put it in ear, it turns off if you kept your finger on the touch panel.I would have liked gew more features like touch response to finger only, With some apps pause play is not supported.but it has all the basic features.","UPDATE: Sept 21It's been more than a year using these earphones.

"For the price, can't complain about the sound signature. Passive noise cancellation, especially while playing music isn't half bad either. Connecting to a device/switching connections though - I have honestly not used a device this bad in connecting to devices in a decade. Either it keeps disconnecting, or only one of it plays any sound. All the rules in the manual is of no help either. Buy this if you're only going to ever connect this to ONLY ONE device in it's entire lifetime and not even think of trying to connect it to a new device after you've set up the first one. Also, most of the steps to factory reset/""fix common problems"" in the manual does not work. This fundamental flaw just cripples the entire experience.For Boat: please fix conection issues! You're killing your own product with an issue that has been solved a decade back.Update (Apr 2021): after ""trying"" to use these for the last 4-5 months, I have come to the conclusion that these are a literal waste of money. Buyers beware - if you're getting good connectivity and your earphones are working fine, that's awesome. But you really shouldn't risk your money on this. Please DO NOT buy this. I cannot speak for any other Boat products, but definitely recommend against this one. Never going to try Boat earphones personally.","For the price, can't complain about the sound signature.

"OK. So, I bought them some 10 says back. Used them for over a week and then returned (replaced) them. This is because I was facing some difficulties with the mic. I fell in love with this product from the first use itself. The sound quality is AMAZING!! The features make it so easy to use. And it has that asthetic appeal to it.But, but... I was facing difficulties with mic, remember? This was especially with the laptop. Hence, I applied for the replacement. They brought the new pair in just a couple of days. But the problem still persisted with the new pair as well!! I was worried about having wasted the huge amount of money.But then I spent some time understanding the product. And found that the problem wasn't, in fact, with the product, but with the settings on my laptop. I had to increase mic volume on my laptop for them to work better!!I also found out another thing. While there is a mic on both the earbuds, only one of them works at a time. And the one working is the one that you picked out first from the box. So keep that in mind. This is not mentioned in the manual. (May be they should -_-) So, this ultimately resolved all my issues with the earbuds, and now I'm a very happy customer of these awesome earbuds. I would say, if you are OK with spending this much amount, just go for these ones!! You won't be disappointed!!!","OK. So, I bought them some 10 says back.

"People.The product is exactly as described and met all my personal requirements (Comfort, sound quality, ear-fit, water-proofing, style, budget etc). I did a lot of research and found this to the Best Value For Money (VFM) ear-buds. The best part (which I was actually quite concerned about) is that they don't budge while running/working out. Although there is no active noise cancellation, it has passive noise cancellation which is awesome at this price range.Also, it comes with a chic and handy carrying/charging case which has USB-C charging and fully charges my earbuds within less than 2 hours. By the way, this charging case has a massive battery life (I have not charged my case ever since I received from Amazon which was in sometime in mid-November and must have recharged my earbuds at least 15-20 times - no exaggerations here.)I am fully satisfied and am sure that you shall be too.Happy listening and working out.Cheers !!!","People.The product is exactly as described and met all my personal requirements (Comfort, sound quality, ear-fit, water-proofing, style, budget etc).

"Must read review to all those thinking to purchase the Beauty!!🤩Design:This is one area I liked the Airdopes very much...Beautiful❤️Looks premium with lighting..🔥Comfort and durability:Very comfortable with most ear sizes and creates a perfect noise free experience. You can use it while exercise or workout. They won't fall out of ears even with intense workout.This ones come with IPX7 Resisant which protects from sweat and splash.Sound and Audio Quality:As expected in most BOAT products, bass is always boosted and the audio quality is amazing. Details in music can be heard very crisply. The perfect noise cancellation has a good hand over here.Latency:There is a small amount of latency observed while playing PUBG. Very minor amount though. At this price point it's very observable. Realme buds Air have low latency and also they are bit expensive.Call quality:Excellent!!Battery Backup:Amazing. 2600mah battery backup upto 150 hrs. Still testing it out. Will update laterFeature:Touch sensors on them work well.More testing is left definately will update this review.","Must read review to all those thinking to purchase the Beauty!!🤩Design:This is one area I liked the Airdopes very much...Beautiful❤️Looks premium with lighting..🔥Comfort and durability:Very comfortable with most ear sizes and creates a perfect noise free experience.

Details in music can be heard very crisply. The perfect noise cancellation has a good hand over here.Latency:There is a small amount of latency observed while playing PUBG. Very minor amount though. At this price point it's very observable. Realme buds Air have low latency and also they are bit expensive.Call quality:Excellent!!Battery Backup:Amazing. 2600mah battery backup upto 150 hrs. Still testing it out. Will update laterFeature:Touch sensors on them work well.More testing is left definately will update this review.",must read review think purchase beautydesignthis one area I like airdope much beautifullook premium lighting comfort durabilityvery comfortable ear size create perfect noise free experience use exercise workout not fall ear even intense workout one come ipx resisant protect sweat splash sound audio qualityas expect boat product bass always boost audio quality amazing detail music hear crisply perfect noise cancellation good hand latencythere small amount latency observe play pubg minor amount though price point observable realme buds air low latency also bite expensive call qualityexcellentbattery backupamazing mah battery backup upto hrs still test update laterfeaturetouch sensor work well testing leave definately update review
"The earphones are not designed well enough to sit comfortably in the ear. The buds go in and are not problematic, but the body is not shaped to be a comfortable fit in the ear. It hurt a lot to keep the pods in for more than 15 minutes. I even changed the tips to solve the issue, but they kept falling out. Also the touch feature is overly sensitive and easily recognizes false touch. An accidental brush while pushing my hair out of my face also caused it to disconnect, when according to the user manual, it should require three taps to disconnect. While on call, the earphones constantly glitched out and sent distorted noises to the person I was talking to (I was sitting in a quiet environment, so there's no question of BG noise)I'm aware these pods don't feature noise cancellation, but they do glitch a lot. I also had issues with delayed bluetooth pairing. Maybe I received a faulty pair, but in three days I was fed up with the earphones and chose to return them. I'm not someone who buys without research, and this product was advertised to fit my needs. Unfortunately, it did not function to my expectations. I have been using Amazon for years and this is the first time I've had to return a product because I was so throughly dissatisfied with it.The airdopes could improve by providing a larger variety of tips and a better shape to fit in the ears. I really liked the Boat Rockerzz I had bought last year so wanted to try Boat again, however this purchase is making me question the brand.","The earphones are not designed well enough to sit comfortably in the ear.

"Writing this review after 6 months of usage.These earbuds are perfect when you want to use them just for listening to the music. The bass is perfect and audio output is truly marvellous. Battery life is also good. With the pods, it will give you backup of around 4 days. Touch is also quite sensitive.However, when it comes to mic, it is horrible. There is no noise cancellation (which is expected at this range) and you have to literally shout while speaking if you want your self heard. In a closed room, the performance is slightly better but not upto the mark. More trouble is there when you connect it with laptop. Mic performance is awfully bad.Overall, if you are looking for an earbud just for music streaming and can compromise with the mic, go for it.","Writing this review after 6 months of usage.These earbuds are perfect when you want to use them just for listening to the music.

"Review after 9 month usage.Pros: The sound quality and noise cancellation are good.Cons:1. The battery is horrible. The right ear pod loses battery quickly. And within a year the battery and charging case are not able to hold up much charge.2. The touch part is horrible. If you're listening to music lying down and you turn to your side and the touch sensitive part of the pod touches the pillow, it pauses music, and even turns off as if it has been done by a finger.3. The notification voice is super irritating! I don't want someone to say, ""Oops! Battery Low!"" to me everytime the battery is low, which is very often. A simple beep can do justice to the notification.","Review after 9 month usage.Pros: The sound quality and noise cancellation are good.Cons:1. The battery is horrible.

"Product was quite good for listening music Don't expect Premium bass levels.I think all the pros are mentioned in detailed product description let's talk about cons:1. After fixing in the ears for 20 minutes and above you might feel slight ear pain2. Attending calls are quite easy but either you nor them can't listen opposite person voice after 10 mins ( happened to me everytime might be I received a defective piece)3. If you are frequently going outdoor I don't recommend this product better go for neckband type ( because everytime you need to put the airdopes in the dedicated case to power it off)4. Designed in such a way, you can't find the one if you lost it ( Easy to pairup also easy to lose)5. Case is not easily fitting in pocket, always you need something to store the case which stores the airdopes 😂","Product was quite good for listening music Don't expect Premium bass levels.I think all the pros are mentioned in detailed product description let's talk about cons:1.

"I ordered this Airdopes set mainly for taking work related calls through communication technologies like Slack, Microsoft Teams etc. The initial set I received worked well but had two issues:1. The left hand side airdope kept disconnecting and reconnecting.2. The call quality was good, but the other party could barely hear me.I pondered over a poor review, but then I changed my mind and checked boat's website. I got their support email and sent them my invoice details. I had barely sent the email when I got a response telling me to keep it ready in a box (any box other than the original box) for pickup. The next day, the delivery exec from Boat had picked it up. I got an acknowledgement email stating that the set had been duly received and that they would be shipping a replacement for me. It was supposed to take 15-20 days. But surprise surprise! It was delivered in 3 days, and now this set is working perfectly. Comfortable, light, looks durable, sounds good and the microphones are definitely good!I'm so glad to have waited before putting in my review. The person at the other end has no trouble hearing me and the buds stay in sync without getting disconnected. I don't have any intention of using this to listen to music, but whatever I have heard while being on hold has sounded really good.Overall I'm very satisfied. And one appeal to everyone - please don't leave a poor feedback based on one experience. Do reach out to their customer support. They are very easy to work with. It might take a a few more days, but these Airdopes are worth it. Sincere thanks to Boat for their wonderful customer service and Amazon for bringing this product to us!","I ordered this Airdopes set mainly for taking work related calls through communication technologies like Slack, Microsoft Teams etc. The initial set I received worked well but had two issues:1.

"10/10 Would recommend this product. Used for a week before I ended up loosing up the carrying case so please don't be like me and make sure you keep the case safe or else you won't be able to charge the earphones. Coming on to the tws itself, The quality is really nice and it has satisfying click each time one would close the case lid. The sound quality is awesome the mids are clear and highs are good. But in bass heavy songs the bass sometimes over powers the mids but that's subjective. The fit of tws are good and fit nicely inside the ear hole. The mic quality is clear and the battery would last around 3.8-4 hours on normal 90% volume use. If battery is pirority for you then please buy one plus bullet wireless z.","10/10 Would recommend this product.

"Quality of the product is decent, Sound is good with rich bass, good for music, or during workout session of 2hrs. The L bud losses it's battery exactly  by 2 hrs of continious music playback, the R bud runs out by 2.5 hrs. Call quality is ok, but in crowded placeses mic dissappoints, have to speak loud or repeat twice or thrice, but in this price point i would not expect more. The buds can be charged thrice + with the case. In case of silent placeses not voice issues. Both the ear buds can be used as single while the alternate bud battery gets drained, and can be charged single by the battery case provided and vice varsa.This is review of one week of use..i would update later.

"Been using the product since a day now. I'm not stunned by the quality but I'm abundantly satisfied with the purchase. The controls will take sometime getting used to, keep the user guide handy for quick reference for sometime till you get accustomed.The earpieces are comfortable, the sound quality great and it easily paired with my iPhone X and Macbook. Since the product supports mono functionality as well, it may cause confusion sometimes - My left earphone paired with my laptop and the right one paired with my phone at the same time. It was a bit surreal.Great product though. At the price point, I highly recommend a purchase!","Been using the product since a day now.

"Love the battery life. I'm quite new to the TWS market. Bought thus airdopes 441 pro for my dad. My cheaper 700rs Sony and JBL CS series headphones have much better audio richness and audio spacing depth. This airdopes are fine too. But I'm not impressed at all. With equalizer, I play around with it to find a better sound suit for me but still, these 700rs wired headsets do much better.Calling too isn't that good, I sit for meetings with this and I often get people from the opposite saying I sound distant or voice level is low. I don't think this has noise cancelations, haven't properly checked that.Overall, this thing is portable, wireless and works on Bluetooth, cool technology stuff, that's all. Not meant for audiophiles and calling purposes.If you gift this to old people like your parents and grandparents, they'll love it.","Love the battery life. I'm quite new to the TWS market.

"The product is good, I like the sound quality. Bass is also good. Call quality is average. If you talk normally, person will hear your voice without any problem. Not sure about the outside.This airdopes is not good for gaming. You will hear the gun sound after one sec. But if you want the airdopes for music and calling indoor, its a good one.Sometime, both airdopes doesn't pair, you simply need to put it back in the case and then open it, it will solve the problem, or factory reset. That's not a big problem I guess. If you know how to wear the airdopes, then there will be no fitting issue.Battery back up is good.Overall, I like the air dopes. Worth it.I received the airdopes yesterday. I will update after one month.","The product is good, I like the sound quality. Bass is also good. Call quality is average.

"The heading sums up everything. The touch panel (CTC) has manufacturing defect. I am writing this after using two productsts. In first case the right bud stopped completely after 2 days of use. Its ctc used to be very sensitive and you will struggle getting correct output basis touch command. In second case, the ctc had no touch response. No light signal, lying dead after its removal from the case, especially the right side one. I tried, restarted, made the factory reset several time, tried different pressure points just to keep my new buds with me and wasted several hours. But response was not encouraging. Sometimes it responded, sometime it simply ingoned my touch command, in the middle of my call, listing music. Finally, with heavy heart i have requested return of this product. The reason for my heavy heart is the music sound quality. Its a good buy (even as a faulty product) for Rs. 300 budget (max), for those who just wish to listen music. Totally unhappy with the product.","The heading sums up everything. The touch panel (CTC) has manufacturing defect. I am writing this after using two productsts.

"It is just rambling bass, with many details lost while listening to music. It responds well to EQ, but problem persists. I bought it for a specific purpose - listening to recorded calls - it serves me well. Battery life is good. Passive isolation is nice. Personally, I did not want to spend a fortune over something which would die in 2 - 3 years. These TWS are also bad for calls. It prioritises background noise over call. Also, they're not good for ladies with long hair. A single strand of hair is enough to stop or pause whatever you are doing - the touch is too sensitive.PS: Though it doesn't bother me, they are made in China. Also, TWS technology has a long, long way to go.","It is just rambling bass, with many details lost while listening to music. It responds well to EQ, but problem persists.

"Not worth it!No noise cancellation makes it extremely difficult for receiver to hear the conversation. Even a fan in the background makes it unbearable to talk. The ultra sensitive touch on both pods gets the calls disconnected every time you try to adjust the pods in your ears.

"Previously, I used Redmi Airdots for almost a year or so, and back in October, I finally decided to upgrade as I was facing a few problems with it, related to battery and usability. And after using BoAt Airdopes 441, I can say for a fact that these are generations better than Airdots. Not only do they have extremely rich sound quality, but the bass is very noticeablely deep. The fit is very nice, and can be used while working out. The battery is everlasting, and the biggest pro about these wireless earbuds is the bluetooth 5.0  as it's extremely quick, and easy to connect. Definitely an easy buy for this budget.","Previously, I used Redmi Airdots for almost a year or so, and back in October, I finally decided to upgrade as I was facing a few problems with it, related to battery and usability.

"Very happy with the product but very disappointed with the fact that the box was already tampered with when delivered by Amazon. The original seal was ripped off and pasted randomly on the box and a separate seal was applied on the box (refer the photographs for reference). In all likelihood, this is a product that was returned by some other customer and Amazon hasn't bothered to check the packaging before shipping it out to me. While the product looks brand new / unused and seems to be working fine, this experience has left me extremely skeptical as to whether or not these would last and give me the reliability and performance of a brand new product.As for the product in itself, it is great and delivers on aesthetics, build quality, sound (great bass for the price!) as well as ease of use. Fits comfortably in the ears and can be used for long periods of time without any irritation / uneasiness. The charging dock is small enough to easily fit in the pocket and I really like the overall touch and feel of the product. All in all, would definitely recommend it if you're looking for reasonably priced airbuds!Hopefully, you would receive these in a brand new packaging without any tampering..","Very happy with the product but very disappointed with the fact that the box was already tampered with when delivered by Amazon.

"It is a good product for the price.Pros:1. Good sound quality for calls and movies.2. Size and pocket friendly.3. Within the budget.Cons:1. Can't use with multiple devices, it gets connected to random one of the many devices you use and not very easy to disconnect and connect to the required device.2. Not great for music, as the bass is substandard.3. Can't be used as workout pods, as they are not tight.4. touch is over sensitive, pauses if anything even brushes against it.Over All:Good for a single user with single device, for gaming and calls.I was planning to use on my Phone and TV, it just doesn't connect to TV unless I switch off Bluetooth in my phone. Similar problem can be faced if any of your family member wants to share it.","It is a good product for the price.Pros:1. Good sound quality for calls and movies.2. Size and pocket friendly.3.

"I brought it for Rs.1399/- and one of the best among this price range.Sound quality: Better sound quality than many of branded rivals.Build quality: Premium look and plastic is sturdy. Looks more branded and compact design. Little pain while using for hours(it can be eradicated when outer wings removed)Bass quality: Enough bass but not much. Bass quality is more than boat 141, realme buds q2 and oppo enco buds.Battery: Used 6 hrs per day for 4 days. Still blue indicator is showing. Battery backup is very good.Touch controls are really responsive. Not responses to accidental touch.Instant pairing technology, BT 5.2, IPx4 water resistant.Cons:No volume control (can't expect in this price range)Size is compatible but little bulky in pocket.Bass is very good but not punchy(but it is enough)Best airdopes from boat.

"I received this 2 days after ordering. Got it on the lightning deal @ 2499. So far, I've been using it for approx 4 hours continuously and haven't faced any problems. Now here's the stuff you are reading this review for :1. Fits super snugly in the ears. I've shakwn my head every which way, jumped around, vigorously too,  and even fallen asleep with these on. They haven't fallen out even once. Yeah maybe if you get punched in the face they could fall off, but i haven't tested that yet! If you use the right earbud size it will fit better i guess. The earcaps are pretty useless in this regard though. They do nothing. Just use the right earbud size ans push it in properly.2. Sound quality is great like you expect from any boat product. The bass is what you bought this for and it won't disappoint. I tested this at both safe and full volumes on my samsung m21 and while the full volume won't make your ears bleed, it's powerful enough to make you uncomfy after 5 minutes. In safe volume state, these are pretty great. Of course i compared these with the brand new boat bassheads 225 i have, and the output from those is louder at the same volume. But that's what i have noticed in a lot of boat products, their bluetooth stuff plays a little softer at the same volume when compared to the regular earphones.Clarity is otherwise good and everything is balanced. You won't need to tweak with the equaliser unlike what happened with the Boult earphones I've used.Call quality is pretty decent too. You can hear the person clearly, no problem there. My friend did say that she could hear my voice clearly, though it'd sound better if i was louder, but I'm in general a very loud speaker. So there's that.3. Looks pretty decent when worn. The touch controls are a little confusing to gt used to without reading the manual 2 times or more. Of course the touch controls are great, but not too fast. They have some delay.4. Charging takes about 1 hour and a bit more. I haven't tested them for how long they can go without another charge so that's next to come.5. The case looks super cute though? It's got a matte finish and you get 3 pairs of earbuds and that earcap thing, a charging type C cable and warranty card and manual.These aside, i can't come up any more points. I hope this review helps.P. S. : i got the bumblebee yellow.","I received this 2 days after ordering. Got it on the lightning deal @ 2499.

"I got this on my birthday on 21st June :) Was initially skeptical regarding the quality of TWS earbuds. But having used other Boat earphones in the past made me go for this over other brands.Using it since unboxing on 21st June and even after 2 days of heavy usage, the charge is still available in the box. Earbuds can go on 4-5hrs on a single charge. Battery backup is indeed good as advertised.Music quality is very good just like any other Boat earphones.Call quality and noise cancellation is better than what I had expected.Haven't tried gaming mode as I am not a gamer but I expect it will be good too.Earbuds are comfortable to the ears even after continuous usage and fit to the ears well.Box pack comes with extra ear tips and a USB Type C charger.Its really worth spending Rs 2500.","I got this on my birthday on 21st June :) Was initially skeptical regarding the quality of TWS earbuds.

"Product is an average one the sound quality is good and the bass is average, Noise cancellation is 3.6/5 and the battery back up is between 2-3.5 hours based on the purpose.

Very good airdope and very beautiful look wise also better sound quality but it's not louder. Infact when your volume label on 80+ than you can real enjoy any song. So i think volume/louder factor should have been better. Clearity and connectivity is outstanding. Specially connectivity distance performance is best in class. No any pain feeling on my ears. Great fixed with both ears. I will give the feedback later about battery backup. Overall it's a great product under this budget 2.5k.,Very good airdope and very beautiful look wise also better sound quality but it's not louder.

"I bought Airdopes 441 Blue in October last year on Amazon. The Earphones worked just fine for 3/4 months, since then the rapid degradation started.....the right earphone lost its volume(minimal output), and since last month the left earphone which was performing at optimal level lasts only about 10 mins.I am still within my warranty period but the claim process is abysmal. I am based in capital city of Odisha and there's only one recognised service center to claim warranty. they don't pickup calls and are 20kms away from me. In these covid times travelling there is very difficult for me.I WISH bOAT introduces online warranty claim and replacement service. i mean brands like senheise,sony provide online replacement within a week. VERY DISSAPOINTED....i bought a Sony earphone now and never looking forward to buy a bOAT product in future.MY POINTS;1. Didn't last a year2.Difficult & unresponsive Warranty claim process.3.

"My first true wireless earbuds! Very good sound quality. Bass is nice, though not very thumpy (I don't prefer very high bass anyway, masks lows). Good battery life as well, full charged once and after 8 days still going strong, though I use for around 1 hour of listening in one go. Case is good, instantly connects to mobile/tablet. Touch controls are good, too sensitive for my liking though. Comfortable to wear as well, you need to find best position for your liking that's it! I have forgotten to take them off a couple of times after listening, these are that comfy! Overall nice buds.","My first true wireless earbuds! Very good sound quality.

These are one of the best ear phone in that price range.. they fit in-ear nicely and anr comfortable over extended length of time.The noise cancellation is superb..!!! Like you literally can't hear anything from the outside..The bass quality is great especially if you use both the dopes simultaneously...The touch panel is sensitive and functional.The only drawback is that the volume can only be controlled by your phone as there is no volume control function on the eardopes.,These are one of the best ear phone in that price range.. they fit in-ear nicely and anr comfortable over extended length of time.The noise cancellation is superb..!!!

"Sound quality:- Good for it's price range. The sound leans a little bit on the treble side but it has sufficient lows. I was actually surprised by the sound quality considering that it is a bluetooth earphone at the 2.5k rangeControls:- The touch sensitive controls are hit-or-miss. They are very well done and very responsive but the downside is that, it's easy to trigger it unintentionally. If your ear itches or you want to adjust your hair or something else, you can accidentally ""press"" the button by gliding your finger over it. Another issue is when using it when lying down, if any skin (usually earlobes or auricle) glazes over the touch sensitive buttons, your video/song might accicentally pause or if it rests on it for 3 or more seconds, the device can accidentally turn off. But mind you, it's just minor issue and not a delibitating one. I'm just noting it down here for future improvements.Connectivity:- This is one thing I love about these earphones compared to others I have owned. It connects easily with your phone, as well as with the other. For example:- You're using only one of the buds, with the other one in the box; after sometime you want to use both of them, you only have to take it out, it'll turn on and sync itself automatically with the other bud. I'm just mentioning this here because with every other bud I have owned, you need to manually resync both buds everytime.Latency:- This earbuds have a signal latency/delay of 200ms. This is pretty low compared to other earbud and neckbands I have tried out and owned. Latency is a non-issue for basic usage but is a big issue for gamers, and 200ms signal latency is very very forgiveable for games (eg:- codm, pubgm, etc) and this is the most useable earbud/neckband I have used for gaming so far (for the record I have tried out 5-7k inr earbuds that have 500-600ms latency.. and this little guy beats them all). As per my experience, any delay that is at or below 200ms delay is useable/forgiveable for gaming. Anything above 200ms, is useless. Sure, zero latency wired earphones are the best for gaming but given this product comes under 2.5k, have good sound quality and connectivity, the ease of use and quality-of-life thing they offer is a very good compromise for the 200ms delay.Overall:- This is an excellent product for it's price range and I recommend it for basic usage as well as gaming","Sound quality:- Good for it's price range.

"Here is my review of the boat airdopes 441 pro earbuds after using it for two days since purchase.ProsSound quality is good. Balance between the highs and lows with balanced treble and bass.Lightweight.Attractive colors.Good battery backup.ConsCall quality poor, not meant for calls.Finishing not that great, could have been better. For example in the charging case the type c port and usb cable port area. You can tell by looking at the enclosure itself which gives the impression of cheap chinese product, not expected for aesthetic point of view , personally I didn't liked the specifications written in the bottom of the charging case with white color, it destroys the aesthetics of the product.Aptx support not available whereas the same is available in this budget.","Here is my review of the boat airdopes 441 pro earbuds after using it for two days since purchase.ProsSound quality is good.

"Honest Review After 6 Months of using these TWS.1.The sound quality was okish.Bass was decent  2/5.2.Noise cancellatiom 0/5.3.Build quality is good 4/5.Now coming to the main reason why i rated these tws 1 star was the problem i m facing in these tws rn is after 6 months the right side  earpiece battery gets drained quickly.I tried to call boat customer care no response from them the number is always switched off. If i try to say that i,ll myself come to the boat service center they simply say that it is closed now.This is the excuse they are giving me from the last 15 days everytime i try to complain or ask them for help.I'll never buy any BOAT product in my life.After paying 2.5k for a thing and getting no service is such a terrible thing.Not only this i bought boat stone speaker too same battery issue after charging for 3 hrs it does not even works for 30 mins such a poor quality they are providing to their customers.","Honest Review After 6 Months of using these TWS.1.The sound quality was okish.Bass was decent  2/5.2.Noise cancellatiom 0/5.3.Build quality is good 4/5.Now coming to the main reason why i rated these tws 1 star was the problem i m facing in these tws rn is after 6 months the right side  earpiece battery gets drained quickly.I tried to call boat customer care no response from them the number is always switched off.

Pros1. Good for music. I have had no disconnection on blue tooth during playing music.2. Build quality is good but could be better.3. Bass is ok types not very good but ok.4. Battery life is also good.Cons.1. Frequent disconnection of bluetooth on calls. Suddenly on calls the eardopes go off air. Big time embarrassment when you cannot hear what the other person has said and you end up missing important conversation. This is my return and the same problem persists and I am returning the product second time.2. No volume or noise cancellation.3. Dual mic missing in each eardope so calls are not good. you need to speak too loud so that the other person hears you.Overall above average type of product for music lovers only. Do not buy if you will use it for calls also.,Pros1. Good for music. I have had no disconnection on blue tooth during playing music.2. Build quality is good but could be better.3.

"This works only with Phones - Android/iOS. It connects as a voice/music device to Windows 10, however the microphone output is not working. The headphones are not useful for Windows 10 laptop for calls. It uses Microsoft driver for the headset handsfree handling, and clearly Microsoft is not able to use Boat Airdopes 441.I cannot believe they will ship headphones which don't work with Windows. Get this fixed, sending feedback to them separately as well.Update - On the third windows 10 machine I tried, the microphone works. So your experience will wary. I am not able to make it work with other two machines. Microphone quality is not something to write about, however that is what one would expect at this price point.","This works only with Phones - Android/iOS.

"The left ear piece stopped working in just 3 months. The right one was still working .. Poor build quality and quality control, I believe.  I submitted an online service request.

The process, though slow and steady, worked in the end and now I have working ear pieces.While I am unhappy that it stopped working in 3 months, I am really happy with the warrantly claim and replacement process.

"1) The product is not worth it at its current price.

Sometimes even disconnects in only one bud and reconnects, giving you a horrid experience when listening to music.8)cannot adjust volume using ear buds.

"After 10 months and 2 sets of these earphones, I can say with clarity that they are all junk. They work fine for the first three months, then one of the earbuds stops accepting charge. In another 2 months, the other one stops accepting charge. But they never mention this... They just die in 2 minutes each time they need to be used.The pins on the box don't sit properly on the earphones, the lid keeps opening, the earphones drop out of the box relatively easily.. The only thing they are good for, really, is as a powerbank. But, then I'd rather have bought a bigger powerbank.Boat customer support seems nonexistent. No one responds to calls. Third party servicemen hate fixing them because they just break again in 15 days, and no one wants to accept this job.All in all, I've burnt Ra. 5000 on a boat of junk.","After 10 months and 2 sets of these earphones, I can say with clarity that they are all junk.

"Was working fine and suddenly the right side went very very low on voice itself , tried all ways but not able to resolve the issueVery disappointed as window to return also closed , trying to find a solutionJan 10th - Writing this review again , after replacing the boat Airdrops from service centre , the airdopes went faulty again on right side after usage of 2 weeks. It seems boat Airdopes have some manufacturing issue which they are not able to solve.  I saw 3 more guys with same issue on service centre , same issue of one ear airdrop going down.

"This is overall a great package...I'll rate it 5/5 because i liked its sound quality specially by bass povIts built is awesome and durableIt looks coolCall audio is good can't say the best one but its still goodThe CTC touch is highly sensitive and responsiveI First orderd it and one side of its touch wasn't working properly, it responded only sometimes and the response time was too slow... After 2 days the touch completely gave up i thought it'll eventually recover, but naah it got worse and at last stopped workingI ordered a replacement for that and it is completely functional and working to its max potential...If you want to go deeper into sound quality...It produces the lows and mids nicelyBut the highs are only good when you turn the volume at 80%+ at this point the vocals and highs suppress the bass and at this volume the lows aren't much prominent...But at the same time at 60% which is also known as the sweet spot for most of the TWS earphones they just perform great..The sound doesn't tatters or distorts even at 100% volume but that's too loud...I'll provide a six of five star rating for loudness if it was possibleA must buy product","This is overall a great package...I'll rate it 5/5 because i liked its sound quality specially by bass povIts built is awesome and durableIt looks coolCall audio is good can't say the best one but its still goodThe CTC touch is highly sensitive and responsiveI First orderd it and one side of its touch wasn't working properly, it responded only sometimes and the response time was too slow...

More over the bass is good for the price range while watching movie and songs.There is a lag while picking up the call. While answering a call using touch sensor in the ear bud there is a minor lag for answering,it won't answer after the touch so usually we will touch it again for answering the call but the cal will drop due to multiple touch...

"Bought just minutes after the Prime Day sale started.

Only difference is in their charging case, which is of 500mAh in airdopes 441 and 2600mAh in airdopes 441 pro.Go for the pro version only if you get it for 2500 else as airdopes 441 costs only 1999 with no major differences.Pros -Good bass and balanced audio between 65-75% volume.Extra sensitive touch controls.Very good passive noise cancellation.Good calling quality.Cons -It hurts sometimes because of the fin shaped rubber (I dont know if the problem is with everyone because fitting is different for everyone as everyone's ears are of different shape)Sometime when watching youtube videos, the left earbud produces static noise and the right one gives the video sound. It only happened with old youtube videos, on watching recent videos I didn't came across this issue.Vocals are on little low side when listening below 60%Final verdict - If you're looking for any good TWS under 5k then nothing is better than airdopes 441 and 441 pro.Go for it without any second thoughts.","Bought just minutes after the Prime Day sale started.

"On the positive side, Guess this is the only ear pod with type c charger in this price band. On the negative side, too much bass which makes your ears tired soon. It fits pretty well on my ears and overall performance is really superb for this price. The Capacitive Touch is too sensitive, it took couple for me to get used to, especially when you try to wear while answering a call. There are two problems i faced (i) few second lag in connection as soon as you answer a call but stabilizes after that. (ii) often the right earbud volume level goes too low and have to factory reset to normalize.

"At this cost (2.5k) its quite decent bluetooth headphones. The bass is not that deep but quite impactfull. The lows and mids are impressive, the volume is low Unless you manually increase it from your device. The case is made of average plastic and holds up well. The battery life is brilliant and as they claim you can actually charge your phone with it if it's an emergency. Overall a decent product from Boat. If you are looking for a bwtger sound quality then I would recommend to increase budget and go for a JBL or sony, but if you are looking for TWS headphones under 3k this one does its job.

"I like the pod's sound overall but it is a bit bass-heavy for me (I am a mixing engineer so I guess I'm just used to flat response headphones).

The pods stopped working after 15 days, I thought there goes my money down the drain.

"Just what is needed for the price, I was lucky enough to get it with a lightening deal.The audio clarity is excellent. The playback hours are really good.

"I have been using it for 5-6 months:Important Points:1) Quality bass for an airpod with really good lows! I really enjoyed every beat.2) Although looks bulky, fits into the ear like a charm. Doesn't fall off unless you hit your ear! Strong plastic build.3) Connectivity is really nice. Happens without a delay.4) LEDs are too attention drawing. Expected some way to control them but there ain't any!5) Battery back up was really good at the beginning but gradually dropped over time. After 5 months, 3.5 hour backup reduced to 30 min.- I have applied for warranty, lets see. Imagine Marketing has a very bad reputation for warranty claims (even their customer care isn't reachable).

"This airdopes is just amazing for its price. Superb comfort. Love the design. The case is itself a powerbank. Stunning battery backup. Sound quality is so crisp and clear. It's not a noise cancelling earphone but while I'm listening to music or watching a movie, there's definitely no background noise that gets through. The bass quality is also fantastic. It pairs so seamlessly with my phone. Absolute value for money product. I'm writing this review after using it for 8 months. I've had 0 issues so far. Love boat. It's just too too good. I would suggest this product to everyone. I wish there was a better rating i could give. Thank you for making such an awesome product.","This airdopes is just amazing for its price. Superb comfort.

It pairs so seamlessly with my phone. Absolute value for money product. I'm writing this review after using it for 8 months. I've had 0 issues so far. Love boat. It's just too too good. I would suggest this product to everyone. I wish there was a better rating i could give. Thank you for making such an awesome product.",airdope amazing price superb comfort love design case powerbank stunning battery backup sound quality crisp clear not noise cancel earphone I listen music watch movie definitely no background noise get bass quality also fantastic pair seamlessly phone absolute value money product I write review use month I issue far love boat good I would suggest product everyone I wish well rating I could give thank make awesome product

"Good quality earphones.... good sound and good battery backup... you have to get used to the touch sensors as it often turns on and off while putting them on or taking off. The large battery capacity for of the case makes a huge difference, I don't charge mine for a week or more! I only wish it had slightly lower and tighter bass, rest all great!

Today I received and writing this review after one day of use.. 1st of all these buds are looking gud and very light weight. Also 3different size of free earmuff to suit your size.good points with these buds are-1. Good looking and very light weight2. Decent sound quality with gr8 bass3. Water resistance.4. Gr8 battery life of around 5-6 hrs and superb fast charging.5. Pairing is just fantastic and ultra fast.6. Not used outdoor but voice quality is decent while on call in indoor.Bad-1. Design can be improve more for better comfort and for heavy users.2. Not at all meant for gaming u can't play games whole using these. Worst gaming experience.3.bass is gud but need to improve for vocal sound and for musical instrument sound.4. Sometime Google assistance not works after lots of try then u need to put these in case and pair again. Alexa works just as charm.So overall gud experience with little issue that may solve later.  Gr8 deal if u buy these on some sale/discount in less than 1900rs,Today I received and writing this review after one day of use.. 1st of all these buds are looking gud and very light weight.

"Writing the review after two weeks of usage.Opted for boat airdopes 441 after a lot of scrutiny and comparison. On paper this is one of the best airpods for the price. Bang for the buck. Glad to say that it didn't disappoint one bit. The sound quality is too good. All notes are clear. The bass at times are too high but most of the times it’s perfect. Not as good as JBL but again keeping the price in mind, it’s worth it. One thing that shocked me was the treble these dopes provided. Absolutely sickening. Imo these are in par with the expensive airpods out there in terms of the treble. They have passive noise canceling and it’s pretty good.Talking about the fit now; I’ve worn a lot of earphones, from samsung to one plus to apple. All of them fit good. But this? This fit perfectly. Exact tightness. If you don’t like the ear pads, boat has provided a couple other sizes too. One of them ought to fit you. These snuggle up so well in my ears that even heavy movement running drills and jump rope fail to trip them out. Absolutely loved it. They’re IP67 rated so sweat us no issue.Now the connectivity; So far everything’s been smooth. I use an iOS. After initial connection it pairs up automatically every time you open and clip it in your ear. IWP.Battery; Battery backup so far is almost what they say on paper. A total of 30 hours playback time. Haven’t tested it for 30 but I’ve used it for long enough. It’s safe to say that it’ll get you through a day usage with one charge cycle.Call; I won’t suggest call on mono mode (only one airdope). But when both are clipped in your ear there’s no trouble and it’s pretty clear. Also a big no to using it for calling purposes in noisy environments.The only problem with these are regarding the capacitive touch. Don’t get me wrong it works fabulously. It’s just that it is way too sensitive. The slightest touch can work the functions. And sometimes I’ve noticed that when my sweat touches it too. But that’s definitely not a very troubling point. Just put it out here.All in all if you’re looking for a good budget wireless earphones with good sound quality and minimal flaws, then the boat 441 is the go to. Hope I helped you decide. Whether to buy or not.","Writing the review after two weeks of usage.Opted for boat airdopes 441 after a lot of scrutiny and comparison. On paper this is one of the best airpods for the price.

"Been using it for a month now ...Sound output is good for basic use - as in listening to music, watching videos and attending calls.There's almost no time lag in connecting to the phone.Range is around 15 - 20 feet indoors. Connection breaks if distance from device is more than this.I have charged the case just once after receiving the product. I use the dopes almost everyday for at least 2 hours. The indicator on the case still shows 50% charge.Build is sturdy.If the music has too much bass, it gets a little harsh on the ears. The buzz if the bass masks most of the other music, but this is only if played on full volume. So I feel it isn't a great choice for people into heavy metal, and even for those who listen to other loud music.Though made in China, Indian brand - another small factor I considered while buying.Overall, I'd say a decent option in said price range.","Been using it for a month now ...Sound output is good for basic use - as in listening to music, watching videos and attending calls.There's almost no time lag in connecting to the phone.Range is around 15 - 20 feet indoors.

"Being very much trusted and popular brand, boat has always kept our expectations high.

"Got these in November 2020. Loved them initially, but could never wear them for long periods. One of them had low volume issues soon, and then it stopped charging properly in the case. Boat was nice enough to collect it from my home, took 3-4weeks to repair it and sent it back to me at no extra cost. So now I have repaired buds that still have charging issues from time to time. The sound is okay, but the pain in the ear is bad, and so is the mic quality. I have taken off the wing tips a long time ago, and tried different tips for less pain, but nothing works.To give you context, the Sennheiser wired earbuds with the small tips are the most comfortable for me. Maybe that's just my ears.","Got these in November 2020. Loved them initially, but could never wear them for long periods.

"The product is definitely good looking. It's compact and feels great on ears. But it's the case that was a tad disappointing. Felt too plastic and feable, as if long term usage can break it.It pairs very quickly and the touch is super sensitive, which is a good thing Ince you learn the tap gestures.Music feels great, it's well balanced and gives a good kick at this price point. But being a bass lover, felt bass is bit on the lower side.Now, finally the call quality. I didn't like the call quality at all. The person at the other end was finding my voice broken and feable. It also seemed that I am speaking from distance with lot of environment noise around me.This made me return it. But, if l calling isn't your concern. I would suggest getting it at 2500. A good deal.","The product is definitely good looking. It's compact and feels great on ears. But it's the case that was a tad disappointing.

"Pros:- Works as advertised for the most part- Light on the ears- Reliable, good sound quality- Mobile call quality seems decent (other side is not complaining)- Pairs quicklyCons- Very touch sensitive - tends to cut off calls even if we touch it by mistake, so one needs to be careful while wearing it- Sometimes I am having audio quality issues. It is choppy- Distance range is not very long. If I walk around or just step outside the room audio quality drops","Pros:- Works as advertised for the most part- Light on the ears- Reliable, good sound quality- Mobile call quality seems decent (other side is not complaining)- Pairs quicklyCons- Very touch sensitive - tends to cut off calls even if we touch it by mistake, so one needs to be careful while wearing it- Sometimes I am having audio quality issues.

"I bought this after reading the reviews from several other Users. And I must say thank you for those reviews !!I am writing a review on this product myself. I found the product very convenient to use without much setup or configuration. It is as easy as open and pull out out the pods and just latch it on into the ears. Fits perfectly and does not fall off even on a sneeze :)The bluetooth reception is fairly good to about more than 10m. The voice quality on the mic and sounds in the pods are just amazing. I have been using this for about a week now and have used it for my office meetings, video calls, movies, radio, phone calls and it just works amazing on all applications.Today is the 10th day after having charged it once when i bought the device, and haven't had the need to charge even now, it keeps going on. One thing that i observed is place the pods into the holder after each use, that helps the pods to sync up and charge up for the next use.Good one for a gift and value for the money. I have used boAt products earlier too and I have had the best experience with it!!","I bought this after reading the reviews from several other Users.

"First all i would like to mention that it is a very good wireless earbuds @1999rs.When u put these airdopes in your ear for the first time u feel wierd because of whole covering the year for noise cancelation. But you get used it. Noise Cancellation also works pretty good. The Sound quality of these airdopes are good. And mind, These Earbuds have much extra bass compared to others. so for high bass lovers these are good. And if u dont like bass, dont go for it. Insta wake up and pair feature goes completeley good everytime. The touch controls are also good with high sensitivity. Charge also remains for good hours both with case and without. And If u buy these for only Gaming purpose, u feel a bit of latency which is common for all wireless earbuds. The Case is small and convenient. The earbuds get into the case smoothly with magnetic power most of times except a few times. I would suggest you this airdopes which are very good at the rate If u like extra bass and for music lovers. And if u are a big gamer who doesnt like even a bit of latency and if u dont like uch bass then u may go for other.","First all i would like to mention that it is a very good wireless earbuds @1999rs.When u put these airdopes in your ear for the first time u feel wierd because of whole covering the year for noise cancelation.

I ordered these about a month ago. At first I received used product from Amazon so had it replaced.Replacement earbuds lasted only for a month. Left earbud couldn't last for more than 20 minutes on full charge. I thought electronics do go bad and that is what warranty is for. So looked it up and they are making me cross almost an entire city and get these to their service center and then I have to do that again to get them back. If it were to have lasted at least for a 6 months then I wouldn't have mind but this is just too much.,I ordered these about a month ago.

"Pros: Sound quality is good. Very bassy.  Battery life is amazing. Feels  premiumCons: After 10 days of use, noticed a slight crackle in the left earbud. So for instance, if you start some video and pause it, there's a significantly audible crackle in the left earbud which is kind of annoyingUpdate (9 months use) : Okay I may have nitpicked in the cons. But these earphones are durable too. I accidentally dropped these in water and sound and bass were gone. Which made me buy realme air buds 2 which has advanced features like ANC and a dedicated software. Suddenly, my airdopes started working. Realme isn't bad but I did not like the transition from airdopes so much. The overall sound quality is so much satisfying on airdopes. I am a bass lover, and these provides authentic bass as compared to a bass boosted mode on the realme, which overshadows other aspects of the song you're listening to. So, I'll say you'll have your money well spent on airdopes. It's cheaper and after all, the sound quality matters.","Pros: Sound quality is good. Very bassy.  Battery life is amazing.

"I bought this in Prime Day sale and honestly speaking this is one of the best deals ever.Sound quality is awesome. Bass is so good that I don't hesitate comparing it with Bose TWS that costs around 18k.People going around saying that it doesn't have noise cancellation. Well yes you can say it doesn't cancel out the noise when you're talking to someone on calls and the other person can hear your background noise on the other side of the call (but that thing is acceptable because it happens in the case of bare naked phones too)but when you are listening to songs, I must tell you it doesn't let you hear whatever is going on the outside. Moreover, when you put on these buds, it already cancels out 50% of the noise whatever is going on around you.It has a massive battery backup (yeah that's why they're taking 1k more than the normal version)The only shortcoming I found was, in low volume (less than 40% vol) the songs feel empty(I mean it doesn't give much bass and the treble is also low, the sound is flat) but hey who's gonna keep the volume low, right? Turn it up to 60% and there you go! feel the nirvana !","I bought this in Prime Day sale and honestly speaking this is one of the best deals ever.Sound quality is awesome.

"Only been a day since I bought.

"Pros1. Better Sound Quality2. Good enough Bass3. TWS (True Wireless Stereo) with IWP (Insta Wake and Pair) works fine4. IPX7Cons1. No ANC - Active Noise Cancellation2. It's a pain in the EAR (personal experience)3. Sometimes only one earbud gets paired, so you need to put them back in the box and open again (typical Indian booting concept 😄)4. You don't get any RETURN option from Amazon, although you get a REPLACEMENT option but the window is open for only 7-10 days from the date of purchaseSo what should you do then?1. Choose the brand wisely2. If you like boAt (like ME😜), then go for 281 in the same price range3. Choose the shape of your earbuds carefully4.

"You must know what you want and what you get at this price... it's not the best sound quality, obviously. But do you need that? If you do, take a gamble, spend 10k online and buy a branded pair. But if your use is just listening to music (like ordinary people, rather than going on and on about bass and high notes and God knows what), listening to podcasts or audio books, think no further, buy it. There is that hum in one of the buds, not constantly but it's there. This has been very useful for me and I'd recommend it to anyone.","You must know what you want and what you get at this price... it's not the best sound quality, obviously. But do you need that?

"I enjoy listening both to music and podcasts, and as such, I keep listening to things throughout the day. And it's not that these earphones are bad from the perspective of sound quality.But, their size is such that it will hurt people because of it's unevenly distributed weight, regardless of what tips you use. The bulk at the back really adds to the pressure. The other issue is that it does not work well on flights at all. Hardly any passive noise blocking, forget cancellation.Overall, it's a fairly priced product and decent quality as well. But if your ear canal is small, the distributed weight issue will affect you.","I enjoy listening both to music and podcasts, and as such, I keep listening to things throughout the day.

"As good as the sound quality is, the connectivity is abysmal. Simply turning your head while using the headphones causes an instant disconnection. I've tried this on multiple devices (not only phones but tablets, desktops and laptops).Notice cancellation is virtually non-existent. It's noise isolation, of course and that itself isn't great.The mic doesn't work anymore. Don't know when it stopped but it definitely worked when I first got the earphones.I'd give the product 4 stars for sound quality. 1 star for build quality. 0 for connectivity.","As good as the sound quality is, the connectivity is abysmal.

"I have been using this air dopes 441 for the last 6 months. I have had my doubts about how it would work and the quality of the sound. These headphones totally surprised me. Sound quality is great. Bass is great. Noise cancellation is good. One big advantage is it being wireless so that we can move about doing our things. One con is that while on calls the other person would hear more of our surroundings, so it cannot be used to take calls in noisy environment.

"In these times of WFH, having a decent pair of TWS earphones is more of a necessity rather than a desire. These earphones are a bang for the buck. I'll divide my review in pros and cons and my experience with the 441 Pro after about a month of use. My review will only be based on the Indoor Usage of these earphones as I am too afraid to use TWS earphones while an outdoor workout or otherwise.Note:- The only difference between the Boat Airdopes 441 and Airdopes 441 Pro is the battery capacity of the charging case. The former comes with a 500 mAh battery while the latter comes with a 2600 mAh battery capacity.Pros:-1. These offer a very balanced sound.2. They have a good amount of bass which is not overpowering and if you use an equaliser you can boost the bass even further but that is not recommended as it overpowers the highs and the midtones.3. They have very good passive noice cancellation. A person will literally have to stand on your head and shout his lungs out for you to be able to hear him.4. The earphones have a battery life of about 5 hours without the charging case.5. The charging case comes with a 2600mAh battery which also doubles as a powerbank. In my month of usage I have charged the case only twice till now and that is when I use the airdopes on a daily basis.6. Has USB type C charging with a charging cable bundled inside the box. You also get two extra silicone eartips for varrying ear sizes.7. The case supports Fast Charging8. The airdopes have a capacitive touch that is surrounded by a ring of led lights which glow in different colors depending on the function they are performing.9. The earphones are very light weight and have an official IP X7 rating making them swearlt proof which means they can be used in the gym or while outdoor workouts though I have not used these for that very purpose.10. The earphones are magnetically held inside the case which provides a secure position to them.11. You can perform many functions with the earphones like pick up or end calls, play/pause music, use voice assistants etc.Cons:-1. The charging case is big and feels heavy when compared to something like the case of Apple Airpods. This might be because of that huge 2600 mAh battery that the case has.2. If you are a sort od person who likes to fit your tws charging case in your coin pocket then this is not for you. It just doesn't fit inside the coin pocket of jeans and you'll need to keep it inside the phone pocket or the wallet pocket because it is a big case and takes up quite a bit of real estate.3. The lid of the charging case doesn't open up sufficiently for one to take out the earphones comfortably. The lid opens at a 90 degree angle which is not sufficient enough given the stability of the lid is low. It has happend many times with me that while taking out the earphones my finger just slightly touches the case lid and it comes crashing down.4. The rubber rings around the earphones that are provided for a secure fit in the ear start causing pain after about an hour or half of use and then you have to remove the earphones. However the good side is that these rings are removable.5. The overall ergonomics of the case and the earphones need a bit of rework for a more user friendly experience.Overall, I'd say if you are a bass head and dont want to burn a hole in your pocket then go for these earphones or even Boat Airdopes 441.Hope my review helps you make an informed decision while making a purchase.","In these times of WFH, having a decent pair of TWS earphones is more of a necessity rather than a desire.

The former comes with a 500 mAh battery while the latter comes with a 2600 mAh battery capacity.Pros:-1. These offer a very balanced sound.2. They have a good amount of bass which is not overpowering and if you use an equaliser you can boost the bass even further but that is not recommended as it overpowers the highs and the midtones.3. They have very good passive noice cancellation. A person will literally have to stand on your head and shout his lungs out for you to be able to hear him.4. The earphones have a battery life of about 5 hours without the charging case.5. The charging case comes with a 2600mAh battery which also doubles as a powerbank. In my month of usage I have charged the case only twice till now and that is when I use the airdopes on a daily basis.6. Has USB type C charging with a charging cable bundled inside the box. You also get two extra silicone eartips for varrying ear sizes.7. The case supports Fast Charging8. The airdopes have a capacitive touch that is surrounded by a ring of led lights which glow in different colors depending on the function they are performing.9. The earphones are very light weight and have an official IP X7 rating making them swearlt proof which means they can be used in the gym or while outdoor workouts though I have not used these for that very purpose.10. The earphones are magnetically held inside the case which provides a secure position to them.11. You can perform many functions with the earphones like pick up or end calls, play/pause music, use voice assistants etc.Cons:-1. The charging case is big and feels heavy when compared to something like the case of Apple Airpods. This might be because of that huge 2600 mAh battery that the case has.2. If you are a sort od person who likes to fit your tws charging case in your coin pocket then this is not for you. It just doesn't fit inside the coin pocket of jeans and you'll need to keep it inside the phone pocket or the wallet pocket because it is a big case and takes up quite a bit of real estate.3. The lid of the charging case doesn't open up sufficiently for one to take out the earphones comfortably. The lid opens at a 90 degree angle which is not sufficient enough given the stability of the lid is low. It has happend many times with me that while taking out the earphones my finger just slightly touches the case lid and it comes crashing down.4. The rubber rings around the earphones that are provided for a secure fit in the ear start causing pain after about an hour or half of use and then you have to remove the earphones. However the good side is that these rings are removable.5. The overall ergonomics of the case and the earphones need a bit of rework for a more user friendly experience.Overall, I'd say if you are a bass head and dont want to burn a hole in your pocket then go for these earphones or even Boat Airdopes 441.Hope my review helps you make an informed decision while making a purchase.",time wfh decent pair tws earphone necessity rather desire earphone bang buck I divide review pro con experience pro month use review base indoor usage earphone I afraid use tws earphone outdoor workout otherwise note difference boat airdope airdope pro battery capacity charging case former come mah battery latter come mah battery capacity pros offer balanced sound good amount bass not overpower use equaliser boost bass even far not recommend overpower high midtones good passive noice cancellation person literally stand head shout lung able hear earphone battery life hour without charge case charging case come mah battery also double powerbank month usage I charge case twice till I use airdope daily basis usb type c charge charge cable bundle inside box also get two extra silicone eartip varrye ear sizes case support fast charging airdope capacitive touch surround ring lead light glow different color depend function performing earphone light weight official ip x rating make swearlt proof mean use gym outdoor workout though I not use purpose earphone magnetically hold inside case provide secure position perform many function earphone like pick end call playpause music use voice assistant etc cons charging case big feel heavy compare something like case apple airpod might huge mah battery case sort od person like fit tws charging case coin pocket not not fit inside coin pocket jean need keep inside phone pocket wallet pocket big case take quite bit real estate lid charging case not open sufficiently one take earphone comfortably lid open degree angle not sufficient enough give stability lid low happend many time I take earphone finger slightly touch case lid come crash rubber ring around earphone provide secure fit ear start cause pain hour half use remove earphone however good side ring removable overall ergonomic case earphone need bit rework user friendly experience overall I would say bass head not want burn hole pocket go earphone even boat airdope hope review help make informed decision make purchase
"General- The airdopes come with a very sensitive touch control panel. A little bit too sensitive but it is also the best touch control in this price range and so is the connectivity.Battery - The battery backup is really good just like it is shown. The eardopes and the charging case charge relatively fast. So if you are looking for battery and can't afford the pro version, go for the base version without any doubt.Sound quality - The sound quality is really nice even with the 6mm drivers the bass and the loudness are perfectly matched for me as I am a bass lover but if you are not one then the bass might be a bit muchLatency - If you are a gamer and want it for gaming then I don't reccomend buying this one or any Bluetooth earbuds. You should rather buy a wired headphone but if you really need a Bluetooth earbud in budget then I recommend the realme buds q as it has a larger driver size, lower price and lower latency","General- The airdopes come with a very sensitive touch control panel.

"For the price, these are a good set of earbuds. I mainly use them while working out. It has a good fit and haven’t faced any connection issues till now. Battery life is also good, though I haven’t exactly measured it. One improvement I can suggest is to improve the build quality of the hinge mechanism for the charging case.","For the price, these are a good set of earbuds. I mainly use them while working out.

My Right Pod discharges very fast. Used only for 20mints. Update: Sent Airdopes for service. The service was delayed. There was no communication from their end.

My right one is working fine the left side isn't charging at all. I understand the delay is bcoz of Covid but my problem is not solved yet.

Bought this product a week ago during republic day offer. This is the first time I'm using TWS buds. That's why I searched alot for these like which one should to buy and what are their pros over wired ones. So at last I chose this one over realme buds q and some of the noise products and many others too. So I have done my home work and it was really time taking like watching abound videos on YouTube and gone through different sites to search for the best. So i can assure you that this is the best quality earbuds in terms of everything but below 2000 price list. Because I've done the research after limiting my budget 🙃.

Amazing product. Currently I'm using realme buds wireless. This is my first tws earbuds. These are the best tws earbuds under 2k. Fits perfectly in my ears. Sound quality is amazing. Bass is just dope🔥🔥. If you are a bass lover definitely this is for you. Build quality is also great. Connectivity is seamless whenever you open the lid it's connect within a seconds.  Passive noise cancellation work pretty well. Instant wake pair function is cherry on cake. Feels premium in hand. And looks is killer and everyone notice due to its RGB lights. Touch sensitivity is excellent. Call quality is good for indoors and but average for outdoors. If you are in a crowded area next person will getting some background noise but that's okay. Consider this price it's negligible.  No volume control. If you are confused between Boat airdopes 441 and Boat airdopes 381. Definitely bought 441. I bought it in lightning deal in 2k. So I would suggest you to buy this in lightning deal.Delivered in one day. 🔥🔥😎🤟🏻,Amazing product. Currently I'm using realme buds wireless. This is my first tws earbuds.

I've known boat for pretty good sound quality and really punchy bass, and this offers that very well these look pretty good too, and sit almost flush with the ear. No protrusion whatsoever.

"So, for people who are thinking of buying these earbuds I would say go for it. Because all that really matters is connectivity and sound quality, for which I think it’s good. The insta pairing works very well for me and the sound quality is also great. The battery life is ok I guess, it’s just 3 hours ( it’s fine for me ). It also has touch controls which makes it easier to use by just touching, unlike the AirPods Pro which requires squeezing, so that’s a good thing. So if you’re a budget minded person who needs the quick pairing feature and good sound quality, I think it’s safe to say JUST BUY IT ( instead of JUST DO IT )","So, for people who are thinking of buying these earbuds I would say go for it.

i really like the product sound quality is good and its look stylish too. The only thing that I find negative about is that when ever i'm on call or listening yo music if i accidentally touch the sensing area the call will cut and music will stop. I wish it had double touch system to close the call and stop the music but aside from the every thing is good.(note-I have long hair and even they touch the sensing area i face the problem that i mention above so make sure to tie you hair carefully and be cautious of your hand when you use them)about rest its great,i really like the product sound quality is good and its look stylish too.

"I got these ear phones looking at all specs and colours. I have used wireless but They were my first earbuds , and after using them I realised what I should have checked into more. These are good for music but two important drawbacks are that the noise cancellation is bad so if you are outside, travelling or in a public place ,you won’t be able to talk on phone with these. With mask in Covid times it becomes more difficult. You have to speak really loud for the other person to hear something and without mask. Second aspect is that they are bulky and heavy, so they tend to fall off easily from your ears, making it difficult to wear them while running and they also make your earlobes ache. So overall not a good choice so be careful if it’s your first time!","I got these ear phones looking at all specs and colours.

Always used BOAT and Loved it. Here is my honest review :1. Comfortable - 4 Star ( May be little uncomfortable for 1-2 days  - I did not feel anything). It's very light weighted you can use all day.2. Audio - 3 Star (With this range it could be better ). Audio is great for listening music but could be better according to price.3. Noise Cancellation - 4 Star ( You will be not disturbed with any noise while listening to songs). Ofcourse it doesn't stop 100% noise but it's acceptable and very nice.4. Battery - 4 Star (7 to 8 Hours without use of Battery Case )5. Touch - 5 Star ( You have to make little habit but this makes the Airdopes so much cool and works just awesome).Overall I think this product is nice and there is nothing negative till now ( I am using since last 10 days). But it could be cheaper or if not then it can be little more better according to it's price. I am satisfied with this one tho.,Always used BOAT and Loved it. Here is my honest review :1.

Amazing bluetooth earphones at this price range. Sound is good for a casual listner but not made for audiophiles. Bass is heavy but not tight. High frequencies are good. Mid is average. Every beat of music is present but not too separated. Worth for the price. One big drawback is touch is too much sensitive. You have to take very much care when placing them in ears otherwise touch responds and song pauses or another action occurs.

"Hi All, reviewing the product after 3 days of use. Below is my feedback :Pros :1. Very good sound quality with extremely nice bass.2. Premium look.3. Long lasting battery and gets quickly charged.4. TWS ia absolutely fantastic, if your Mobile's Bluetooth is on and you open the box , it will automatically get connected. If your music player has a setting of 'Play songs automatically as soon as Bluetooth is connected', you will be able to listen songs immediately.5. Provided extra buds for ear adjustments.6. LED indicators  on battery changes its colors depending on the % remaining7. Very light weight box and airpods.Cons:1. Very sensitive capacitive touch. You can't adjust the airdopes during the call , if they are touched even by Mistake, the call will get disconnected. Happened to me several times.2. No volume adjustment through touch. You will have to adjust via mobile phone/connected device. So if you are connected to TV via Bluetooth, the volume control through both remote and airdopes will not work3. The quality of the mic is not that great, next person complained that they are hearing low sound. Happened with different persons.4. Doesn't fit perfectly , there chances of falling down while exercising, happened with me.5. Box looks delicate, need to handle with care and save it from falling.6. IPX6, we should get IPX7 at this price level.Overall 3.5/5. Expected more from boat but overall okay. Make your choice accordingly.","Hi All, reviewing the product after 3 days of use.

"So okay I am a person who doesn't know in depth about all these prerequisites like bass, treble or equaliser. I just gotcthem today and I am loving the sound. Voice quality on call is really good. I was a little worried to buy this and literally searched and compared it to jbl's other tws models and even boat's own models. I got a little help as it was the modified version of airdopes 441, which had so many youtube reviews. The day I bought it, there was no review or youtube video exactlyy about this product. But the fit is so perfect, I am loving it. My ear size is a little small and I wasn't sure whether I would be comfortable or not ! But to my surprise, it's really fulfilling. It's not my first boat product and it sure won't be my last . And I have ordered the sporty blue one , and thought it would be looking pretty bright royal blue as is in the picture above. But in reality, it's not that bright coloured. It's a decent blue one. Although I really don't know if the promised battery back up of 150+ hrs is true or not as I haven't used it more than 2 hours. But so far it's the best one that one can get for 2.5k","So okay I am a person who doesn't know in depth about all these prerequisites like bass, treble or equaliser.

"I liked this product it is a nice choice.First of all I bought this one @1999 on lightning deal, friends its actually worth for 1999 only.Someone looking for a Good Airdopes with touch sensor with less expectation this product will be good for you.Listening music is good (good quality of Bass) and you will get an Avarage call quality.

"This is a highly overrated product! I’m writing an honest review after one month of usage. Worst thing is that Amazon doesn’t allow return of this product and only replacement is allowed.Okay, so the design of the product is not at all user-friendly, it causes great discomfort and pain in the ear even after 20 minutes of usage. If this was not enough, it keeps falling out of the ear and you have to be careful while wearing them. Talking about the sound quality, it’s very, very average - just not worth the money. Bass quality too is really bad. Battery too drains out quickly and you have keep charging them repeatedly. Coming to the touch panels, too sensitive they are. Many times, if you’re getting a call and you have to quickly wear the two Airdopes, it’s highly likely that you will end up touching the touch panel and thus disconnecting the call. The entire thing is very inconvenient to use.Overall, very unpleasant experience with this product, please don’t buy, don’t fall for this worthless product.","This is a highly overrated product!

Everything's good including the case and buds. But one thing i can't help to notice is that i hear a minor buzzing sound iny left bud whenever i pause the music. I would be careful for that thing.

"Got it yesterday.. these are the views of one day usage.Pros:- Big battery (2600mah) case makes it easy to handle the buds instead of charging it everyday.- Connects to my phone as soon as under 2 seconds of case opening.Cons:- Buds doesn't fit in ears correctly, I tried with all silicon ear pieces that they gave.- The silicon ear pieces provided are bit tougher than what I got for my other wired phones- There is no place to hold the earbuds without touching the captive touch sensor which is not convenient (we end up answering the call while keeping the first ear bud in the ear and ending the call while keeping the second one. Very bad design)- Earbuds battery level are not properly being displayed in the phone- Earbuds charge very quickly... Like in maybe 10-15 mins or so... Which is weird... I think they are not properly displaying the battery level.- Not comfortable in the ear, this button earbud design is hard to handle than the aripods design. Airpods just sit in the ear canal... These have to be pushed inside the ear canal and lock them for it to be properly be in the ear.- Sound is not that good.. I would say close to average quality... I feel good when I take them out of my ear.. you get my point with this sentance.Am planning to check for another day or so and see if I should keep them or return.The only reason I am still thinking of keeping these for now is the Big battery case.Will edit the post after 2-3 days for more info.Edit1:I returned it on 3rd day as it was hurting my ears while keeping them on.I learned that we don't need that Big battery case as in general cases we can't completely drain the buds and case charging in a day or two.The sound quality is not good as its bass is not equally distributed is what I felt.There are other better options in the same price range like oneplus buds z and other brand TWS.IMPORTANR NOTE: DRIVER SIZE DOES MATTER A LOT ON SOUND QUALITY.","Got it yesterday.. these are the views of one day usage.Pros:- Big battery (2600mah) case makes it easy to handle the buds instead of charging it everyday.- Connects to my phone as soon as under 2 seconds of case opening.Cons:- Buds doesn't fit in ears correctly, I tried with all silicon ear pieces that they gave.- The silicon ear pieces provided are bit tougher than what I got for my other wired phones- There is no place to hold the earbuds without touching the captive touch sensor which is not convenient (we end up answering the call while keeping the first ear bud in the ear and ending the call while keeping the second one.

Product is good. Sound Quality and Noise Cancellation are good not as good as the high end items but for the price under 2500 these air dopes are good. These works well with the phones. But these are not useful for webex meetings on laptop (Other side cannot hear you).. But the one side of Air dopes stopped working after 10 days. And the Boat Support is very lengthy. Though it is well structured it takes a huge lot of time to replace or repair the product. I had raised a support ticket on Boat Support portal on 10th of October 2020 and today is 19th ot Oct 2020. The product is still in transit and not yet reached the Boat store (Mumbai) where they will verify and repair or replace the product. Whole process takes 18-20 Business days as per them. No Boat support center near by in Hyderabad city to repair the product. It has to be sent to Mumbai where they will repair the product. This is too big process.Update 28/Oct/2020: Product sent for repair on 10th Oct 2020 and until now I didn't hear any update on when the product will be repaired or replaced. Worst customer support.

"Music and cinema sounds great in this airdopes and the fit is also amazing. It wont fall off your ears for sure.The only problem i felt is about the mic, background noises are more amplified than the one who speaks. So its very difficult for the other person as they get a feel like the call is on loudspeaker.Apart from this music listening and fit this product is superb. Battery backup is also obtained as promised.","Music and cinema sounds great in this airdopes and the fit is also amazing.

"For some of those who don't know, there are two different ways bluetooth headphones communicate with other devices. First one is used for one-way communication (for music). This is in stereo mode. The second mode is used for two-way communication (for talking on phones, meetings etc).This headphones work great in one-way communication, for music. Although bass is not that great.However, it does not work very well in second mode. Often both the ear pieces will play sound at different times. There is a lag between two ear pieces. Also, microphone is not that great. Other people often complain that they are getting a lot of background noise.

"The BOAT Team did well on the product with all the good intent but there are some points which I did not like:1. The touch (capacitive?) is too sensitive. Slight touch of your hand will trigger the function.2. Both ear-buds' batteries do not last for the same time. One of them dies sooner making you switch to mono. I had gotten my first ear-buds replaced for this issue but it persists with the second set too.3. The ear phones cannot be used seamlessly with laptops. Although they can pair, but there will be audio delay/lag.4. Volume is tad low.Good things comes in small packages:1. Good bass2. Good noise isolation (passive).3.

"Firstly the product is fine for the price range of Rs 2500 and please don't give more than that for this product.Why I returned it?1. Very bad sound in the background when the earbuds were not playing anything. (might be a defect in the product I received)2. Build quality is not great.3. I mainly bought it for the battery backup but I was disappointed with the audio which is much more important to anyone.4. Delay while watching some videos. Controls work sometimes and other times I don't know why they get stuck.I feel, if you want good quality in audio without a very tight budget then if you shell out another Rs500 to Rs1000 you can get really better ones.","Firstly the product is fine for the price range of Rs 2500 and please don't give more than that for this product.Why I returned it?1.

"I usually don't write review unless the product is truly impressive but whenever the product quality exceeds your expectations, you are compelled to write a review. Being Gadget freak and Audiophile, any Audio product I buy the core criteria has to be BASS effect. Whether its Car Speaker, Woofer, Subwoofer, Sound bar, Headphone, Earphone and these days Airpods... The first thing I read in product review is BASS Effect. After having returned 2 Airpods earlier due to Ordinary Sound Quality, I wasn't expecting too much on BASS Front. But since I already have one Boat over the head, bluetooth headphone I was aware of Boat Audio Quality so went for Boat TWS 441. And I can say if u r BASS Crazy like I am, u at least wont be disappointed. Forget not that this is earphone and not headphone so u can't have too loud a sound. But I am truly impressed by the Booming BASS effect of this piece. It has become my go-to earphone for listening to my favorite Audio Tracks.","I usually don't write review unless the product is truly impressive but whenever the product quality exceeds your expectations, you are compelled to write a review.

"This review is after 2 months of daily use. I got these in Aug'20 for 1999/-.The buds and the box is made of plastic and is very light. There is no premium feel to it.They are a good deal when compared to other earbuds for the same price range. On an average the ear buds last for approx 3 hrs on a single charge. The box and the buds together last for almost 20 hours. Charging time is approx 2 hours. The earbuds have a audible battery indicator which says ""Oops Battery Low"" when the battery level in the buds drop to around 10%. There is also a battery indicator that is displayed in the notification bar of your phone.Considering that both the batteries in the earbuds are the same, the right earbud battery drains more quickly than the left. The left will work for another 30-45 minutes after the right one has died.The sound quality is good however the bass is a little to much. However, Boats are known for their high bass earphones. A Boat app with equalizer and other functions would have really made a difference, however there is no equalizer option, neither can you change or control the volumes through the ear buds.The audio quality and clarity during calls is good.The Bluetooth reception however is not too great. The buds tend to loose connection with your phone at a distance of approx 15/18 feet. Sometimes a single wall between me and my phone can make it loose connection.The capacitive buttons work well but are a little too sensitive. If you accidently touch the bud when you touch your head or ear, it will register as a press and will pause or change the track.Will need to see how they perform over the period of time.Overall this is a good buy for the current price range considering the playback time and sound quality.","This review is after 2 months of daily use. I got these in Aug'20 for 1999/-.The buds and the box is made of plastic and is very light. There is no premium feel to it.They are a good deal when compared to other earbuds for the same price range. On an average the ear buds last for approx 3 hrs on a single charge. The box and the buds together last for almost 20 hours. Charging time is approx 2 hours. The earbuds have a audible battery indicator which says ""Oops Battery Low"" when the battery level in the buds drop to around 10%.

"Great design love how it's compact and simple, fits perfectly in my ear with the default buds if not there are different sizes to choose from. Seemless paring on any device (PC, Game console, Phones are the ones that I tested on, no issues whatsoever) However don't recommend it for gaming! Okayish battery life around 4-5 hours on a single charge and the case can charge up the buds upto 3 times with a full battery of itself! Touch controls are a bit fuzzy sometimes doesn't work that well especially in wet conditions or if you're covered in sweat or water! Bass is good, noise cancelation works really well and over all feels premium. Totally would recommend it!","Great design love how it's compact and simple, fits perfectly in my ear with the default buds if not there are different sizes to choose from.

"The airdopes just got delivered and I've spent the last hour listen to them without a break. I don't think I'm taking one anytime soon.I must say I'm really impressed with the quality of this product. Offers amazing base with clear trebles. For the ones who are sceptical about the noise cancellation I must say it isn't bad, maybe just a notch below par the standards set by its other features.The functionality is fairly simple compared to other products in the same segment.Loved it!A big shout-out to boat (Vocal for Local) 🙂","The airdopes just got delivered and I've spent the last hour listen to them without a break.

"Bought it one day. Then i wanted to return it the next day. Why? u may ask.Main reason - The touch response scales from very bad to non-existent.Mini reason - doesn't fit well in my earsOkay then... I got to know that u can't return this wonderful device on 1st attempt coz replacement policy comes 1st. U see... I'm a sensible person and was like '' no problem! The replacement might be better''.I received the replacement few days later.Surprise! Surprise! They fooled me twice. The earbuds worked well... Only for the 1st 2 days. Then came the same inevitable touch response problem. I was like ""ugh... They work sometimes when I reset the buds. I'm all for Indian tech so I'll try to manage. I'll just stop using the touch controls''. (lemme tell u that I paid 2k for this)2 days later.....chapter - 2 had begun.One of the buds kept disconnecting constantly and required frequent resetting of the buds. This! My friends... is where I draw the line. I want to return it asap. But that thing is.. It is midnight rn and u can't return this item without talking to a customer service person 1st (top-notch huh?!).Hmm...

"One day it just stopped working.. there was this connecting sound and all. But the songs played on the phone just couldn't be heard in the earphone.. I tried with another phone too.. same.. but, some days later, it started working properly..This puts doubts on its reliability..Also, when I talk on it, the person on the other side hears the noise in an amplified way.. don't know if there are any adjustments that can be done to rectify this..So, noise cancellation, I'd say, is very poor..","One day it just stopped working.. there was this connecting sound and all.

"These Airdopes are good as compared to others in the same budget. Sound quality is excellent. One may face range problem if you phone is in the pocket he or she can face noise distortion some times. Moving further, batter life is very good not as mentioned but still okay. Looks are perfect but you may get bit low vibes from inside. Fitting is perfect you can use these while running, jogging and gyming. They don't get harmed in sweat but I haven't tried them in water. Touch function are not that much quick. If you are looking for good Airdopes under 3000 INR you should go for these.","These Airdopes are good as compared to others in the same budget. Sound quality is excellent.

"I rarely write reviews. This is a great product - only for the first year. The moment it stepped on the 13th month, issues popped up (mine is in the 14th month). The left earbud currently has only 30 minutes of battery life - pathetic!!! Also, every 1 or 2 minutes either of them will lose volume and i have to put it in the case and take it back out to regain the volume. Cannot use it anymore for movie watching, music or even online classes. If not for that the product is amazing. But whats the use... a butterfly doesn't live long. So, buy the product with that in mind.","I rarely write reviews. This is a great product - only for the first year.

After using these airdopes for around 3 months i am writing this review and i must  saw it is an another awesome product with a good price as always.I bought it in a sale and got it for 2500Sound quality is awesome and bass quality too is terrific.If you talk about noise cancellation it is also very good in terms of other products  in this price range.There are three issues(major or minor you decide on your own)-:1. Battery life for each earbud is low as they comes with a small battery and case gives them 4 charges as said by company but the battery life of each of them is just 4-4 and half hours with continous usage with volume 60%-70%.2.This might not be an issue for people who only just loves bass but these airdopes are pre configured by company to give maxx output in terms bass this means that vocals are little suppresed by bass all the time and you want vocals to be good and bass less then there is an option but it depends on device i.e by using equalizer3.I think this is a major issue that there are no touch controls for adjusting volume of airdopes and it is set to 100% everytime you start them for laptops it is always set to 100% when i connect them but in smartphones android normalizes the volume to 40%And if you are planning to use with smart tv then forget about it as there no controls on buds for volume and most of the smart TVs don't support volume adjustment of bluetooth devices from them.Thank you for giving it a reading and i would be very happy to help fellow buyers.,After using these airdopes for around 3 months i am writing this review and i must  saw it is an another awesome product with a good price as always.I bought it in a sale and got it for 2500Sound quality is awesome and bass quality too is terrific.If you talk about noise cancellation it is also very good in terms of other products  in this price range.There are three issues(major or minor you decide on your own)-:1.

I bought this with some trepidation as a few reviews had said the voice quality over calls was just average. I use it mostly for calls at home and found the voice quality to be excellent with the person on the other side able to hear me clearly.  I have not tried it outside in a noisy environment. The monopod function also works well and the buds stay firmly in the ear. I have used it during workouts both the weight lifting and the HIIT variety and the buds have not come out. The shark fins are made of rubber and are quite comfortable.,I bought this with some trepidation as a few reviews had said the voice quality over calls was just average.

"I bought this product a while ago and I loved the product. The sound quality is great and the texture and comfort of wearing the airdopes is great. The only disadvantage is that it does not have much of a noise cancellation. The person we talk to can hear background noises and it kind of annoys the caller. Since the place where I talk in does not have much noise, it's a very useful gadget for me!","I bought this product a while ago and I loved the product.

"If you are a fan of bass, you will definitely love this TWS headphones. I'm not a huge fan, so I tend to use an EQ whenever I use this.It is very comfortable in my ear and I am able to wear it for extended periods of time, even for 3-4 hour stretches.The battery life is as advertised for me. The case is small, and sturdy. Type c charging is also a huge blessing, as I don't have to carry a micro b cable just for my headphones. It charges pretty fast as well, in about an hour or so for complete charge.The controls on these headphones are a bit finicky as they are capacitive touch, but there are a lot of different options-skip tracks, call up assistant, pause-play, answer/reject calls etc... but there is one control that is missing-Volume Control. You can only control volume from your device.That's about it. It is definitely worth it for the price. I got it for 2k, anything above that I think is a bit too much. Don't expect Jabra Elite/Sony level quality. You get what you pay for.","If you are a fan of bass, you will definitely love this TWS headphones.

"Writing this review after 8 monts of purchase. Great bluetooth devce. Just perfect to wear with hardly any pressur on ear canal and at the same time fits snugly. Sound quality is really good with nice bass. Touch sensor is sesitive enough but i face the problem only while pocking up the calls, otherwise its nice. Accidently one of the bud fell from my hands in water pothole some 7 months back and fortunately nothing happened to it. Its still functioning without any trouble. Truely waterproof we can say. On the battery i rarely charge it when i travel in my car, may be once or twice a week or so, and have never faced the problem of completly drained batterry. All in all i will its a value for money device. Go for it.","Writing this review after 8 monts of purchase. Great bluetooth devce.

"If you don't play anything or pause the sound for a few moment, one of the earpiece automatically gets disconnect. This is super annoying as well as irritating. Suppose you have to talk to someone or listen to something in between the songs or videos and you pause the sound. At that moment one will get disconnected and if you start the song or video again, you will only hear it in one of the earpiece. This makes it impossible to interact with people in between you songs. Suppose You have a helmet or a scarf or something around your head or the case is not easily reachable. In that case you have to remove the helmet or something, remove both the earpiece, put them together inside the case, close the case and connect it again and insert it again in you ear. This makes it super useless for day to day life activities. I don't know why one disconnects if the song or the video is paused for a moment.

"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of usage. This is gonna be a detailed review and I will cover mostly all the features and topics.Pros:1. The sound quality is extremely good, clear audio and detailed treble and bass.2. The bass is deep and covers all the high, mid and lows.3. The IWP-Instant Wake Pair technology works pretty well the phone almost instantly gets paired there sometimes might be a slight delay of 2-3 seconds for pairing when you open the case.4. The battery inclusive of the pod and case last for about 2 and a half days when used extensively.5. Charging is quite fast with the type-C charger.6. Noise cancellation too works pretty fine.7. The fit is superb, it doesn't fall off your ears even when you ride a bike or scooty and your body jerks due to the movement.Cons:1. The major problem I faced is the connectivity, the range isnt very strong and you will face issues like choppy and laggy audio when you and your phones are 2 small rooms apart.2. Though this isn't a major issue and i faced it only once, sometimes when you use two pods separately there is an audio imbalance. For example, I took out one pod out of the box and decided to use it for 15 mins and then decided to plug in the other one into my ear after 15 mins so the 2nd pod i take out of the box doesn't plays the audio until you keep both the pods in the case close the case and reopen it.Overall, it is a good product in such a price range and I would recommend you to buy this.","I am writing this review after 3 weeks of usage.

"Sound quality is good and seamless in connecting with mobile each time. small earbud fits well. if fits well in ears, is great and also helps noise cancellation. Can do exersice wearing it wothout any issue.

"VERY BAD &WORST FOR CALLS. CANT HEAR VOICE AND SPEAK. AMAZON GIVES ONLY REPLACE, NO REFUNDIf you are looking for this product to be used for calling, you will be highly disappointed as speaker is of worst quality. The person on the other side of the phone cannot hear you as your voice is not clear. There are no reviews related to this feature and therefore I ordered the product. But returned it the next day itself.Sound quality is awesome only for music. Too bad for calls and specially when you are in crowd. Battery is okay, not so bad.Worst part is the rubber material in earbuds...used as a crown or fixer or whatever, 15 mins maximum and then it will start paining your ears from outside like hell. 3 hours maximum and your ears will swell from outside. It feels like barb wire connected to your outer ear.Voice quality on calls is not good. You have to speak a little louder than normal which is not feasible at most times. And there is a lot of noise on and off calls. Because of noise during calls, i had to disconnect the call in-between and talk through my phone. This is not why bought this wireless earbud. And after using it for nearly an hour, there is pain in my ears.Totally this one utter waste,no noise reduction, recipient couldn't listen our voice properly. Moreover its sound quality is really too horrible. Voice is too low and not able to listen opponent voice.VERY VERY BAD &WORST FOR CALLS. CANT HEAR VOICE AND SPEAK 😭😭😟😟😡😡","VERY BAD &WORST FOR CALLS.

"For an average music listener, I would say that these ear-buds are quite decent for daily use. they connect to one device at a time through Bluetooth. These earbuds fit snugly on ears and comfortable to be used for 30-45 minutes at a stretch. Battery backup of the power bank is excellent and lasts more than a week if used a couple of hours daily.","For an average music listener, I would say that these ear-buds are quite decent for daily use. they connect to one device at a time through Bluetooth.

"I have been using the product fir the last 20 days now. Here is my opinion about the product. Would also like to mention that i bought made in India model which costed me Rs. 500 more1. Sound Quality is really good. Though you need to keep the sound more or less at maximum all the time. The quality of sound is really good2. Grip of the buds in the ear is really good, it doesn't fall out and I don't feel any discomfort over long hours3. Battery backup is good. I couldn't check how long it works as everytime u remove it, u need to put it back in the case and it gets recharged. However, the battery backup of the case is really good4. Sound clarity on the voice call is really really good. It's the feedback shared by people who talked to me on the earbuds5. Bluetooth connectivity is impressive. It instantly gets connected to my phone once I take it out of the phone. Range is also very impressive. I can take a voice call in another room while keeping the room closed in which the phone is placedOverall a very nice value for money buy at this price point","I have been using the product fir the last 20 days now.

"The regular price is 1999 but I purchased it in 1799 when the sale was going on.Amazon delivered it on time and the packaging was ok, I mean there was not any second box making it safer though there was only polythene and then the original box itself but not the big issue here I guess.1: Talking about the product, The build quality is pretty good. It gives premium look. The case along with eardopes is not too heavy but the eardopes having satisfiable weight to feel something good quality.2: Connectivity is very fast, you just have to pair manually the first time, and then it would connect automatically within seconds after opening the case.3: Touch Sensitive button work very well but it does take a second response. Also, these buttons sometimes annoy. Like if you are just readjusting your eardopes then accidentally the touch may respond ending up pausing the music or hung up the call.4: Battery is pretty good, I use 2 to 3 hours continuously without using them and the case can be alive for up to 2 days if you are not a heavy user.Not good is that your ear will start hurting for sure if you are using them for more than 45 minutes.Pro tip: If you want to use both eardopes to different devices then connect both with one device, keep one eardope with that device and walk far away from that device taking another eardope until it disconnects. Then when it disconnects, connect it with a different device there only. Come back to your place and voila enjoy both eardopes as different Bluetooth devices.","The regular price is 1999 but I purchased it in 1799 when the sale was going on.Amazon delivered it on time and the packaging was ok, I mean there was not any second box making it safer though there was only polythene and then the original box itself but not the big issue here I guess.1: Talking about the product, The build quality is pretty good.

Probably would give 3.5 stars.The left earbud though keeps falling off, I don't know whether its the ear or the earbud itself😅.Another major defect is the battery life, it doesn't last 5 hours on a single charge.

"Everything is perfect about these earphones. Bass is superb. Best in this range. A treat for music lovers. But it is a pain in the neck for calling purposes. It is tooooo sensitive. If u even touch it slightly while touching your hair or re-adjusting them a bit in your ears, it would cut the call. It does the same if you are lying in ur bed and it touches your pillow. It is also loose in my ears so I dread to wear it out. But if u are looking for music purposes, then go ahead, I feel it's the best in the range.","Everything is perfect about these earphones.

I am using this for about 15 days now. I am an huge fan of boat. I am almost using 5 products of boat. For this Product Sound Quality is good. You actually have to reduce the volume after listening for some time on high volume. Touch sensitivity is good but requires 1 second to take actions. You can use it while riding in Helmet but sometimes the listener won't be able to hear your sound while on call. Battery life is actually better than i expected. I saw the reviews that a person need to charge it after using it for a couple of hours.. Actually it is not happening in my case. Idk 😅 I have been using them for hours and then I get bored with them and you can easily put them back and let them charge. Even I haven't heard any battery low sound yet.One can purchase it..I suggest you to hear BELIEVER 8D in this.. You will be in love with these. 💕,I am using this for about 15 days now.

The company seems to assure guarantee of 1 year but it started malfunctioning withing 4months. Is this kinda commitment you provide to your customers?

"I have been using a boat roakerz 335 wireless band before, mainly for Gym workouts. However, at times during workouts, you don't really feel comfortable with the band as the ear bud keeps popping out. And there is no function controls other than changing volume, every time i have to tap next from my phone to play next song.Then ordered this one, sound quality is amazing. It comes with pre-built function, where you can change next track with a single tap, touch controls are so soft. As soon as I received the product, played 8 D, 16 D songs of A R rahman from you tube, you will definitely feel the premium sound quality.The case is so handy, easy to carry and it comes with charging cable as well. Doesn't take much time for full charge. At this price, you wouldn't find any other brand with such quality sound. Go for it, its worth it.","I have been using a boat roakerz 335 wireless band before, mainly for Gym workouts.

"You should definitely buy this set of earphones if you like to waste your money. Amazon doesn't take its returns and the only option we have is to exchange these. The problem is with the model, it is bad, no matter how many times you exchange it. I have never seen earphones that don't even get properly charged. Apparently only one earpiece gets charged and the other one clearly doesn't fit the case well. Lights don't work on one of the earpieces. I replaced it for these two reasons but the new one shows the same problems. The microphone is terrible. I am blown by the fact that this product has a 4-star rating. It's not even worth half its advertised price in my opinion. Boat's quality is usually good but this model is bad by all means.","You should definitely buy this set of earphones if you like to waste your money.

"I was apprehensive of these before i bought them. But as soon as I put them in my ears, all my doubts vanished into thin air.*How's the fit? - Couldn't be more secure; be it headbanging to heavy metal or a long run. The buds won't budge, not at all.* The battery life seems to be too good to be true, is it? - You get exactly what you see. The battery life is a banger. You can listen to these on long hikes and runs, without the fear of not being able to charge them.* Is the sound quality good enough? - boAt does say 'NIRVANA', right!?* Will it be able to handle sweaty workouts? - IPX7 rating!! Just took a long shower in these and couldn't be any happier. If it can handle a full on shower, then don't you worry about your sweat.For the discounted price of 2500, it feels like i have cheated boAt out of the money that they so rightfully deserved.","I was apprehensive of these before i bought them.

"I've been using this product for 3 months noe and thought I should post an overall review.1. The sound quality here is really good. Although I gave a 4 star, cause there's always room for improvement.2. There's no complaint about battery. Once paired, the bluetooth earphones run continuously for 5-6 hours without any hassle (less time for music and more for calling feature). Also, once completely drained, the fully charged case can charge the earphones 100% in just a matter of minutes. And due to type-C charging, the case doesn't take much time to charge as well.3. Poor bass, only 2 star for that. But then be realistic, such a small item cannot provide you higher bass. If you prefer bass more than anything, do not havr high hopes while buying this item. For me, the bass is perfect.4. Noise cancellation is pretty good. I often get chappal from my mom for not listening to her at all. Helps you go through boring lectures as well.5. Sometimes, there's a minor connectivity issue. I don't really know why this is happening, but it usually doesn't bother me much cause it gets solved by putting the earphones in the case.","I've been using this product for 3 months noe and thought I should post an overall review.1.

Not for gaming btw! These are just marvelously great, they connect to your phone within 3 seconds after you open the case and if ur bluetooth is on, a very few times u might face one of them or both not working, it happens maybe once in 4 months, just turn off your bluetooth on the phone, put them in the case, close it, open it again, and tap both of them 3 or 4 times continuously, blue and green lights will blink and boom, they bd working again!

"I have been using these earphones for past 10 days and I wish to give my honest review. I ordered these after searching for quite a while and the initial quality was amazing, but after using them for a couple of days it started getting disconnected with my phone. Thinking it might be the phone issue, I tried with another phone but it kept on happening. The voice started to flicker and the connection is not proper.Checked the return policy and Amazon replaced the unit but even the replacement unit is having the same issue. I would like to raise a complaint and get refund for these earphones.","I have been using these earphones for past 10 days and I wish to give my honest review.

A special note: if using for calls try to talk in a quiet place as the eardopes do not have ANC so even the slightest sound is heard. Else the product is good. Because extra earbuds and ear support is given it becomes easy to fit any size of ear. Using for a long period like 5 hrs can cause pain in the ears. But overall great product. Would rate it 4.3 out of 5.,The battery backup is really amazing. I brought the airdopes in december and till date i haven't charged the whole case even once. The sound quality is good.

Everything was perfect including the sound quality and bass. But the important feature that is lagging is the battery backup. I used it at 100℅ volume the left ear lasts for around 150 minutes and the right ear for around 115 minutes. But the company claims for upto 5 hrs. So considering the efficiency to be around 72-75 ℅ it should at least last for around 3.5 hrs. But it failed.,Everything was perfect including the sound quality and bass.

"There are many aspects to rate truly wireless earphones, out of which 441pro performed decent to well in most aspects. They're comfortable, gives pretty good sound quality and decent bass performance.The only 2cons that made me return the earphones are1. High latency/lag during gaming. I could observe a very minor latency while watching Netflix on mobile.2. Touch sensitive buttons are not so responsive and some times the song gets paused for like no Reason.","There are many aspects to rate truly wireless earphones, out of which 441pro performed decent to well in most aspects.

Amazing product for the price.My advice go for any true wireless but it should have a secure fit feature so that it does not fall off.At the same time also check if you are comfortable with something pressing in your ears as these sometimes ache if you wear it for a long duration of time.Sound quality is amazing there is no issue in listening to music.Calling is also perfect you have clear conversation on phone.Noise cancellation is also perfectOnly thing is you cannot control volume.Size is amazingly small but sufficient and easy to carry in pocket.The charger is slightly tight. You have to press it hard all the way inside other wise it will not charge.One small issue for iPhone users is you will not have a fast charger of 2A so it may take longer time to charge if you do not have any other charger. So please take this into account.I have tried wearing it for a very long time and my advice take a break for after 1/1.5 hours to let your ears rest.,Amazing product for the price.My advice go for any true wireless but it should have a secure fit feature so that it does not fall off.At the same time also check if you are comfortable with something pressing in your ears as these sometimes ache if you wear it for a long duration of time.Sound quality is amazing there is no issue in listening to music.Calling is also perfect you have clear conversation on phone.Noise cancellation is also perfectOnly thing is you cannot control volume.Size is amazingly small but sufficient and easy to carry in pocket.The charger is slightly tight.

"It has been 6-7 months since I have had these. So many issues , the touch doesn’t work effectively. They are supposed to disconnect from the device if they are charging but it just stays connected , and the battery keep draining. The sound quality is bearable at the most. And this is the one I received after I sent back the first one in which you could hear a buzz through out . Not a good buy. My previous Bluetooth earphones worked for almost 2 years, this purchase is quite a disappointment.","It has been 6-7 months since I have had these.

I received a faulty piece as the right ear buds charge holding capacity was very low initially and now it doesn't power On at all. Left ear buds touch function doesn't work properly. I have sent numerous emails not getting proper response in terms of service or replacement I have been following no updates so far. Boat customer service number doesn't work either always busy. After sales support and service is really pathetic and appalling.

"Long story short - I'm lovin it.Got myself a BoAt airdopes 441 Pro on 26th Oct sale costing me 2250 INR and got it delivered the next day. I like classic black colour so don't judge those pics.Now let's go see in detail what i got at this price -A charging case with 2500mAH capacity -  came in 75% charged in box.  case has the left(L) and right(R) pods mentioned, glad to see this small detail from BoAt.A flat wire USB-C cable roughly 1 ft in length (top right in pic).3 pairs of SML ear plugs. 1 extra M sized plug is affixed to earpods itself.1 extra pair of rubber sleeve (top left in pic). Really mindful of BoAt to include an extra pair.Now let's talk about the real issues.Build and visuals -Earpods are made of plastic but sturdy and feel well made.Pods look quite small in size at first but are heavier once placed in your ears. Heaviness takes its toll gradually on your ears and you may feel it all the time.The EarPods are bit slippery when clutched in fingers and may fall if not handled properly.Touch surface is decorated with RGB lighting and looks awesome.Material of provided sleeves and eartips is also of good quality and soft to touch.Charging case is a bit bulkier compared to basic model given larger battery size. The flap (top lid) I felt to be a bit flimsy compared to entire case, could have been a bit heavier.Usage -The EarPods are rated at 35mAH each with a usage time of 5 hours playback. I have been using it non-stop at 50-60% sound output and for me it has lasted for more than 5 hours in continuous usage.Touch controls are good addition as it eases a lot of operational headaches however response could be a bit better. I found that after pausing the music I could put my hands down easily before playback was actually paused.You can use each EarPod separately and it is able to function on its own for both music and calls.Call quality is actually quite decent which was a bit surprising for me for such price range.Controls are simple -  Single touch for play/pause and receiving calls (any ear).  Double touch left earpod for previous, right for next and any of them for ending call.  Long press for deactivate/shutdown the EarPods.EarPods feedbacks with ringtones when turning on/off or (un)pairing.They automatically get disabled after a few minutes if disconnected.Could not muster up courage to test IPX7 water proofing but if any brave soul can muster up the courage, put your results here. :PSound/Music QualityGreat, for this price range). I have been using MI In-ear pro wired headset for last 3 years and it’s comparable to that with better bass.It’s a bit Bass heavy but hey most of us like that, don’t we ;)Sound  I found a bit muffled and soft when on call but everything was clear for communication.RangeHaven’t tested range of 10 meters in open area but indoors could at most walk 3 meters with wall(s) in between. I found sound to be breaking when beyond 2 walls (6 in thick).Still need to check call quality in open and loud areas. Will do that once out of house at a busy hour.As a general user, so far I have found the airdrops 441 pro to be of my liking. I hope you will also feel the same.The star rating on Amazon does not do justice to this product and should be between 4 and 4.2 stars.Go for it. Its a very good choice for casual users at this price range.","Long story short - I'm lovin it.Got myself a BoAt airdopes 441 Pro on 26th Oct sale costing me 2250 INR and got it delivered the next day.

I got replaced one against the previous but with the same nois problem in left bud. In left bud It sounds ( like durdarshan tune) bip for some time when ever it connects to the device that is my mobile and it also sounds like that on the starting of any vedio or audio. So after using two different 441 i can surely say that all of the boat ear dops might be defective. And main thing is that this product is fulfilled by amazon. So you can think what the Amazon fulfilled products might be. This product really does not justify the price. You might get it at more lower price but as per me it is not worth at all.,I got replaced one against the previous but with the same nois problem in left bud.

Call clarity is also good. The other person might get a bit noise when in heavy traffic or very windy area.Connectivity is also good. But after 10m distance you might get disruption in connection.The battery back up is also decent enough.

"Believe me, you will not find a better one in this price. This is an independent buyer view. Despite of anti-china made wave in country I had to go for it due to budget constraint. In this low price range, the sound quality , range of bluetooth connectivity, technical specifications can only be fullfilled by boAT. One of the USP is the Capacitive Touch Control. Its sensitive & it distinguish between one tap vs two taps vs 3 taps very  intelligently.  Noise cancellation is very effective. Bike riders are recommended to use one bud while riding as you will not hear anything. I felt that voice is little less clear on phone calls (specially when you are moving or walking or running) as people on call ask to repeat what I speak but then its 4 out 5 times work really perfect. Go for it if you are planning a ear bud experience in low price. Charging time is 3.5-4 hours for full charge and continuously it runs for approx 5 hours including music and calls. It fits very well in ears if you are an adult. It comes with a C type cable and additional buds as per different ear size so can be used by kids. 100% phone volume will make you feel like you are experiencing a home theatre or a DJ club.","Believe me, you will not find a better one in this price.

"I learnt  a lesson and i am sharing my experience here, so that someone can benefit from it. Atlast no-one can make all mistakes himself to learn a lesson.Before reading my review, please note that i am an audiophile, loves trying different kinds of headphones, earphones with varying tech like wireless, wired or combination of both. I always go for good brands, but this time some person suggested me and i was having low budget and needed some day-to-day headphones.Now note :1. You would never need the advertised big 2600 mAh battery for so called EMERGERNCY purposes to charge your phone, and when i say never, i mean it. I thought of same, never used it for that purpose ever. So if that big advertisement of big battery and 150hours of charging was one point for buying it, cross it out.2. Sturdy, yes they are composed from good quality of PLASTIC, and i mean they are lightweight so even if you drop them from 33,000 feet, they won't break. But i guess you are not planning to put it under hydraulic press anyways.3. Not good bass or doesn't make different pitches or notes sound that much clear. Average on that point.4. BIGGEST DRAWBACK IS THE DESIGN OF PRODUCT AND SOFTWARE USED. See when you buy a wireless earphone you expect it to use without much involvement of your hands right. Now with this product, the accidental touches makes the listening experience far worse, they pause the song in between even if the surface gets touched by a blanket of your pocket cloth. Not that touch sensitive. Very poor software design. It makes the listening experience a wrecker.5. Now coming to the last point that they stay in ear with their ERGONOMIC DESIGN, poor claim....believe me they won't stay in your ear if your are planning for gym or running.I would say invest some more money and go for good brand like skullcandy, sony, jabra. Please don't fall for the advertisements.PS: boat become popular cause of low per capita income and it offers very poor quality. While in brands like sony, skullcandy, jabra...they invested years and years to have that kind of experience. It the years that you would pay for to buy their product and you will definitely notice the difference.","I learnt  a lesson and i am sharing my experience here, so that someone can benefit from it.

"Starting with sound quality, it's pretty good, bass is not evenly balanced but can be managed with volume. Talking of battery backup, it performed way better than my expectations. It can function for more than 20 hours if used efficiently. Touch is too sensitive also it can't control volume. For that one has to use mobile or smartwatch. Volume control is an essential function which is missing in airdopes 441. Connectivity is great, it can work within the range of 6 to 8 m. Bluetooth actually means good coverage and it's fulfilled in here. I also faced a latency of 500ms while gaming and using social media. It looks cool something boAt is known for. In short, it's worth buying.","Starting with sound quality, it's pretty good, bass is not evenly balanced but can be managed with volume.

This review after 3 months.1.  When I recived the Boat 441 in first time feels Good in Bass and sound clarity.But battery backup of carry case is only sufficient for 2 times full charge of ear buds.In the same time buds battery backup is good enough for 3.5 hrs. So I plan to change the carry case.But boat service center says not possible to change carry case only.We are sending charging case along with buds.I said ok.2.Wthin 1.5 weeks I received  another set. But this time Ear buds sound quality and bass was very poor compared to previous one.Also backup of buds only for 2 hours maximum. But carry case is sufficient for 4 full charging near to company said. So I again disappointed and plan to return for another pair.So again I went to boat service  center. This time they have stock in ready for giving me on the spot .I replaced old one.3.Now this time situation is good sound quality and bass as I received first time.

"Bass is very boomy. I shouldnt complain becuase I wantd it to be a bit bassy. Problem is - there is no way to tone it down as and when needed. On dialogue heavy things like podcasts or movie scenes the heavy bass is kind of drowning voice. You can hear the sound but wont understand a thing.Wired earphones work with device equalizer on both pc and mobile. But BT earphones usually wont do that.Got it for 1999 and overall its ok product. After a long session has to go to low volume to recover from the bass fatigue thats all.Fits ok, not falling off, has enough volume too.","Bass is very boomy.

For using it while doing some swift movements gyming Or running ensure the pod is fixed well in the ear the extra fin like things really helped the pod stay for some time in my ear.

The range is surely 10 mtrs from the phone. Using only a single pod works really well. Battery back up is yet to accertained.","Really liked it.

"It's an average product.Fit and ergonomics- not a solid fit. Kinda 3/5. But the main problem is with the soft touch button. Since the fit is not good, every time you adjust your earphone. When you do that, the soft touch just pauses music. You keep tapping it to revive the music. A big let down. So 2/5 on that count.Sound quality: again very middling. But considering the price point, kinda ok. Probably 3.5 out of 5  for sound quality.Usage with phone call: don't use it. The person other end can't hear you, unless you shout. That's only indoors. For outdoors, forget it","It's an average product.Fit and ergonomics- not a solid fit. Kinda 3/5. But the main problem is with the soft touch button.

The airdopes 411 arrived well on time even in the pandemic situation. The bass is very good. I have used them for 5 days now and they are working very well consistently.Calls are a little tedious because i touch the sensitive touch thingy by mistake and it does it's job of cutting the call XD. Works well for zoom calls as well you just have to select the correct microphone outlet in zoom.It is very convenient to use as someone who has only one type c port for charging as well as earphones I am glad to get rid of the cycle of getting a connector and my earphones stop working and when i get new earphones mysteriously the connector stops working :'(. But now i can listen to music and charge at the same time. It is good for excercise as well as i attended an online zumba class with these on and they were perfect. Personally it hurts my ears after long use sometimes but that can be a personal issue and insie it has different sizes of buds and the other ring thingy so you can adjust as per your comfort. This price for such a good trendy product with good sound quality is a dream!

"After buying urban 2020 and wings earbuds I bought these. First order was a defective item, stopped working within one hour of usage. This one is good. There is short ticking noise u can hear from left earbud but as u play song/movie ,it stops.Sound is loud enough.. Good bass. U can't control volume. But all other controls are highly sensitive. The fit is amazing. It doesn't come out while working out. Or even skipping. My ears are small. I got urban 2020 pink coloured, amazing earbuds. But my ears started hurting with short time use only.. N fit was not as good as this one. And also they are not as costly as other branded earbuds. Very nice product, beautiful.. Looks cool.","After buying urban 2020 and wings earbuds I bought these.

Bass is good not bad, voice quality is not up to the mark or I can say you shouldn't expect a good voice call quality with ear buds coz the air flow will surely be a disturbance when talking.I won't compare the pros and cons but if you are not concerned about the battery life like the non-pro does not have 150 hrs so you can buy those and save a little.If you are a person who likes trekking or long drives literally long ones ;-) then go for the pro version.Once again don't expect a good quality with the voice calls when there is air flow over the mic.If you want for the sole purpose of driving and talking this is not for you, go for the ones that have a shoulder band, those mic quality are much better compared to this one.","Guys, this is a good product with a good quality of sound.

"Its a really good pair of Airdopes. Good bassJust at the low volume its a bit too soft need to keep the volume on 65 percent onwards to get a really good feel. Distance from the phone pretty much 10 or 15 meter later it get a bit faded. Looks too good permium quality the led lights on the CTC ( capacitive touch control ) . The fit is too good if any problems you feel its a bit loose change the ear tips. It fits really well in helmets but an advice do not use both together while riding a bike you literally can't hear much . The CTC button is too sensitive but need to get used to it.The colour variant is too catchy really nice. I was expecting a big charging case but when I saw it was so small like literally fits ino your palm.Iys has magenetic charging so your airdope dont fall off and the lid is magnetic so it wont open unecssarily. Its has a C type charging port thats one great thing done by boAt since most of the phones have C type charging port you wont have to search for a charger. I just got it today still need to play around with it will update in a while . Overall great product ,only the volume at the low which does'nt sound great needs a bit fix but thumbs up great product must buy.And great delivery and packaging by Amazon","Its a really good pair of Airdopes.

The touch, the touch is a bit complicated in this earbuds, I dont know whether this is the case for all tws, but for this, when your skin touches the charging pins on the ear buds, only then the touch works, So for the touch to work on the ear buds, you've got to place ear buds in a certain way, that touches the charging pins to ear's skin.For me touch is not at all a problem, So, I dont have any issues with that, but if thats important to you, you might wanna think about purchasing this product.

My friend bought the older version of airdopes for 1500 bucks and that is much better quality and does not have such connectivity issues.

"Previously I thought I will get used to them... But the thing is these ear-buds are not at all good.As a music lover I have used products from many different companies... I also own BOAT headphones which are good. That's the reason I preferred Boat over Chinese TWS ear-buds. But I was wrong.Call Quality - 1/5Connection - 1.5/5 you have to connect manually or more than once because of sound glitch 8 out of 10 times.Sound quality - 3/5 Overloaded with bass. Misses too much of highs and mids.Verdict- I have used a lot of headphones and earphones... And believe me. I am regretting buying these. If you want to waste your money you can go for it otherwise buy OnePlus or spend more on better products.Edit: after 6 months of buying, left side tws stopped working. They provided me a refurbished unit as replacement, and after 6 more months the left side stopped working again. Now these are out of warranty, and I have to buy new tws. Paid 2,500 for 11 months...

"if you just care about listening to music its perfect for you it has a good overall bass quality in the price range, it doesn't tell you on what RF its working but it has a range of 18.6m without obstruct i can feel the latency if you move the reciever or the source (your head or your phone) repeatedly but its too little that it can be ignored for general use afterall it works on RF so latency is just physics can't do much about it in any wireless system transreciever bandwith is good you can really appreciate the diversity of each soundwave in a song obviously if the song has got it, i also used it for my morning run no effect of normal sweating so far i will surely not do a water resistant test on will but so far good.. case battery is 500 mAh and 35mAh per earbud if you use 1 at a time you can get along a day or more on a full charge(case+buds) with normal usage, non-stop playback time is 4.2hrs for each earbud which i would say again is good but not great you can use 1 bud at a time to maximine the total play time, case recharge both of your buds nearly 4 times on a full charge, its good for non network gaming with negligible a latency but network/internet/online gaming is NOT RECOMMENDED not just on this but on any wireless set.. it will give you out of the world latency. thats my 2 month use review on this product, hope it helped.","if you just care about listening to music its perfect for you it has a good overall bass quality in the price range, it doesn't tell you on what RF its working but it has a range of 18.6m without obstruct i can feel the latency if you move the reciever or the source (your head or your phone) repeatedly but its too little that it can be ignored for general use afterall it works on RF so latency is just physics can't do much about it in any wireless system transreciever bandwith is good you can really appreciate the diversity of each soundwave in a song obviously if the song has got it, i also used it for my morning run no effect of normal sweating so far i will surely not do a water resistant test on will but so far good.. case battery is 500 mAh and 35mAh per earbud if you use 1 at a time you can get along a day or more on a full charge(case+buds) with normal usage, non-stop playback time is 4.2hrs for each earbud which i would say again is good but not great you can use 1 bud at a time to maximine the total play time, case recharge both of your buds nearly 4 times on a full charge, its good for non network gaming with negligible a latency but network/internet/online gaming is NOT RECOMMENDED not just on this but on any wireless set.. it will give you out of the world latency. thats my 2 month use review on this product, hope it helped.",care listen music perfect good overall bass quality price range not tell rf working range without obstruct I feel latency move reciever source head phone repeatedly little ignore general use afterall work rf latency physics not much wireless system transreciever bandwith good really appreciate diversity soundwave song obviously song get I also use morning run no effect normal sweating far I surely not water resistant test far good case battery mah mah per earbud use time get along day full chargecasebuds normal usage non stop playback time hrs earbud I would say good not great use bud time maximine total play time case recharge bud nearly time full charge good non network gaming negligible latency networkinternetonline gaming not recommend not wireless set give world latency month use review product hope help
"Awesome earpods from boAt. Sound Quality is excellent as the other boAt products provide. Noise Cancellation and Bass quality is also very good. The touch functions which are provided like receiving and rejecting calls, changing and pausing songs those are also very useful. I will not recommend it for gaming purpose, because there is a slight latency while playing games. Only a small drawback I found that is the touch surface is very sensitive, for that even when you try to adjust the earpods in your ears, that time also it takes the touch and performs the functionality. Apart from that the product is very good.","Awesome earpods from boAt. Sound Quality is excellent as the other boAt products provide. Noise Cancellation and Bass quality is also very good.

The sound quality is superb. Bass quality is good. Sporty look. Only issue is with Connectivity. Often losses connectivity while on call or even on music mode. Touch is highly sensitive. Issue with battery back up. As shown here is 4 hours at one charge but I feel it is not more than 1.5 hour at once with continuous music mode I have tested personally. However case has only back up of 500mah only. Don't know how much time it take for charging with case. Continuous use not possible however better choice 441 pro has more battery back up. Buds have limited touch control. Multitasking or multifunction is not supported this is big issue. Further siri or Alexa or Google speak works only when the phone is unlocked. Often faces problems where one buds battery gone and others have it is big confusion. Notice cancellation not working properly. Faces issue with noise cancellation. Also faces problems while working over call wid buds about eco sound and other disturbances sound due to use of buds. Overall it's a okay product not worth at this price where better options are available in mkt.,The sound quality is superb. Bass quality is good. Sporty look. Only issue is with Connectivity.

"I'm writing this review after 1 week use of the product. I'm specifying the points about which everyone is concerned, before buying an earpod:1. Terrific sound quality with ear-satisfying bass.2. 0% (zero percent) audio-delay/lag while playing pubg or any other game.3. Call quality is terrific, the person on the other side can listen to your voice clearly and you don't have to shout. The product is having a passive noise cancellation technology due to which the microphone cancels the noise while taking the audio input.4. Airdops touch control is seamless, be it accepting/rejecting calls or controlling music/video.5. Battery life is good, it runs more hours than it is specified. But if you are in call aor play games for a longer time then it would last for the number of hours it is mentioned in the specification of this product.6. Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity is seamless, it gets connected automatically whenever the box is opened. (Provided that it is connected manually for the first time only)7. Light weight and you would have no pain in your ears even if you wear it for 5 to 6 hours at a stretch.","I'm writing this review after 1 week use of the product.

"Airdopes are good for attending lecture, watching videos, listening song but attending calls can be difficult  due to no noise cancelation.For calling you hav second option to hold you another buds near your mouth so that the other person can hear you clearly and that's  the only to fix that.

"I've purchased many ear buds over the years but these ones have really inspired me to write a review. The battery life with case have totally eliminated the dependency on wired earphones. The bass in these is literally ear rattling and I mean it in a good way. Also it's quite some hassel when you use touch control on wireless ear buds if they are not sensitive enough and require you to press them a little hard for the touch to be recognised, and it becomes painful if you use touch very often.But the touch sensitivity in these is next to perfection. The gentlest of touch is enough for it to recognise and that has made all the difference.","I've purchased many ear buds over the years but these ones have really inspired me to write a review.

"One side earbud had buzzing noise and became very quiet after only a few months. Got a replacement unit and even that too started having the same issues and the left earbuds dies after just 15 minutes of use (without any battery low warning), while the other works for a few hours. Also the volume levels are vastly different for different apps and types of content, unlike other headphones. Music apps are extremely loud, whereas video content is very quiet at the same volume level. Also the connection is lost randomly when you pause the content, but it will still show that it’s connected, so have to disconnect and connect again. This issue happens very frequently.","One side earbud had buzzing noise and became very quiet after only a few months.

"The Boat Airdope 441 is totally worth every penny. This advanced wireless earphones are classy and come with fully capacitive touch controls. The box comes with 3 pairs of extra ear buds, one charging cable and an user manual. The sound quality is pretty great. The ear pieces fit in snugly into the ears and stay right in place despite a lot of head movement. The microphone is very good and one can easily answer phone calls with the earphones as the sound is clear and crisp. Although personally I did not like the constantly blinking indicators on the earpods, it's hardly a blip in the design. It is overall a great investment.","The Boat Airdope 441 is totally worth every penny. This advanced wireless earphones are classy and come with fully capacitive touch controls.

Enjoy the movie and music without any lag or discomfort.4.

"I've been using this for 3 weeks now. This product is for those who loves bass,no need to set bass booster mode on equalizer with this.  I used to listen to music by setting equalizer to bass boost mode but with this one u feel little bit discomfort bcz of over bass. Even normal mode gives very good bass from very low volume .i read a review that we need to turn volume to above 60 to get better sound but i din feel like that .i used to keep volume around 20 to 40% n it works well at all volume levels. Noise cancellation is not much effective but it's ok by me. Best fit in ears and u can do any kind of workout it won't jump out.

The ear caps are too big and keeps falling from my ears. It is NOT returnable so people with small ears stay away. They will replace but who wants replacement if its fit is bad. Sound quality is also not the best and I struggled to pair it with PC. Not worth the price and you might as well invest in top brand.,The ear caps are too big and keeps falling from my ears.

"Rating 3 because of mic issue. I have replace this product once but with other pair of airdrops still facing issue. If you want to use this for as headphones then go for this but if you want to use for calls then waist of money. Mic quality is very poor. Capture background noice, voice level is very low. You have to shout then only other person can listen to you.","Rating 3 because of mic issue. I have replace this product once but with other pair of airdrops still facing issue.

"I liked the sound quality.I strongly disliked the Bluetooth connectivity, It shows connected in mobiles, but you can't here audio, in 6/10 times. I checked multiple phones. It randomly goes mute. First i ordered the same device it didn't connect at all, and opted for a exchange and got a new piece. It worked well for few days then the problem started, being using it for past 6 months, got vexed with this device. Didn't expect this from upgraded version and from a brand like Boat.P.S - My air dopes 311V2  works good even after two years. Didn't expect the new one to be such a pain.","I liked the sound quality.I strongly disliked the Bluetooth connectivity, It shows connected in mobiles, but you can't here audio, in 6/10 times.

After going through reviews..I thought let's buy. But trust me.. it's not that great option. Sound quality is average but left earbud was not working..no sound so it's useless. Rather invest 1000 more and buy good one.Raised replacement but I am really not impressed with the product. There was no return option...which is bad. Let's see! 😖,After going through reviews..I thought let's buy. But trust me.. it's not that great option. Sound quality is average but left earbud was not working..no sound so it's useless.

"In the beginning it was really fine but later on it started showing its true color. Using this airpods is so painful. Most of the times i am holding one airpod in front of the mouth and other plugged in to my ear, even then sometimes my voice is not clear. Too many complaints from my friends and i realized this is the worst choice i ever had. Now after using it for 3.5 months i see strange things. I find it hard to connect to my phone. Sometimes even after getting connected it does not work, sometimes only one airpod works, as if its totally in the mood of the airpod if it wanna work or not. Now I am thinking to get it replaced or probably buy a new one. Bluetooth airpods in this range sucks.","In the beginning it was really fine but later on it started showing its true color.

This is the first time I have bought a product of boats and I totally unsatisfied and regret of doing that. When I have recieved my earbuds they were working fine but just after one day the right one stopped working. I have asked for the replacement and the this time the left one stopped working within a week. I went to to there service center and that was another level of painful experience. I have to wait almost four hours just get my number in waiting line. All the staff was super slow there. After that I recieved the third pair of earbuds in a replacement of the defected one but guess what this time the left earbud continuously make a wierd noise of 'weeeeeeeeeeep' and this sound gives pain to my ear after certain time of using it. After having this horrible experience I have lost all my energy and decided to let it go and promised myself to never use any boats product ever in my life.

Brought them for my Mother, after my Wife was enjoying a previous TWS version for more than a year.

"Used it for 12 weeks now (3 months) and all I can say is it's a very 'meh' product, extremely mid (average) sound quality, try using equalizer to get better sound quality, I use the Wavelet android app for that. Bass is somewhat acceptable but there is lot of distortion at higher volumes, tune it right and it sounds good. Microphone quality is fine but prone to noise so use it *only if you are indoors* seriously it is impossible for the person on the other end to hear you when you are in a noisy environment. Play/Pause delay is a little too high about 1 second should be somewhere half of that. Double tap to switch tracks took a lot practice to get used to to get it to work accurately even now I fail at it sometimes, this definitely needs improvements as it's somewhat annoying. No swipe volume control. Voice assistant I never use so can't comment.One of the better things is that each ear bud can work independently of the other, i.e you can connect either one of the ear buds without having to connect the other, this is a problem on some other brands like Jabra from what some people have told me. Pairing process was without much issue, but it's a little troubling that the ear buds are always in paring mode after taking it out of the case as someone can just randomly decide to connect to your ear buds if your own device does not connect to it quickly.Battery life of the ear buds is decent, about 4 to 6-ish hours depending on usage. Power-bank functionality is pretty useful helps in a pinch used it a few times. The cases battery is huge compared to the buds so I recharge it once in 2 weeks if I did not use the power bank feature.Comfort is subjective but for me initially I couldn't wear it for longer than 2 hours straight on the left ear and for 1 hour straight on the right ear, but after 2 weeks I got used to them can can wear them for 5+ hours. Sometimes laughing or running around while wearing them causes it to pop out, most likely a 'me' problem.More about the case, there is a cover for the ports so there's some protection for it but the covers flexible plastic hinge may break off if you are not careful when charging it. One thing to be careful about is to charge the case you need to have a USB Type-C cable with a thin casing else you can't insert it properly as the port cover gets in the way, my Amazon Basics Type-C cable does not fit for that very reason. The charging cable provided in the box is pretty flimsy looking and short so don't try to use it with other devices.The size of the case is huge compared to competitors so it looks awkward in some pockets this is mainly because the case is about 3 cms thick at the thickest part, if they could make it a little thinner it wouldn't be as noticeable. I wear jeans and T-shirts so the shirt somewhat hides the massive lump, it definitely won't fit in small pockets so not really suitable for office work environments as it looks awkward in pants even when standing, but this makes sense as a design choice as it seems to be marketed towards young adults (teens -> university students) since they usually use backpacks to carry around stuff.Haven't gotten it wet yet, so I can't comment on the claim of IPX7 splash resistance, I don't exercise while wearing them so can't comment on that either.As with any product treat it right and it will last you quite some time. Overall pretty satisfied with this 'meh' device solely because of the price point.Will update more on battery degradation later, but for now it seems right ear bud lasts a little longer than the left one about 15 mins longer. - 01/02/2022","Used it for 12 weeks now (3 months) and all I can say is it's a very 'meh' product, extremely mid (average) sound quality, try using equalizer to get better sound quality, I use the Wavelet android app for that.

"This is first TWS after a good research on you tube and on official brand websites.I have been researching about getting a nice TWS earbuds for my everyday use.I wanted a product with great built quality, a decent battery backup and a good sound.The buds are very cool looking with a sleek and stylish recharging case of Active Black color. They are multifunctional buds with decent features packed. We get touch control system which is very active in response even on a slight touch we can see the effective response. The features very easy to use as just by tapping on the touch control, we can access all the controls of the music. And with the same ease we can check the check the charging left in the charging case just by pressing a button on the case.The pairing system is also very smooth. For the first time we just have to pair it with our phone, and then after that whenever we open the charging or carrying case and the bluetooth of the phone is on then automatically they will connect and disconnect after placing in the case and closing it.Pros1. Balanced Sound with a nice blend of Bass, Treble and Mids.2. Type C Charging - I use a Samsung galaxy f41 so it is much convenient to manage things with one charger.3. Decent battery backup.4. It doesn't feel bulky in the ears.5. Charging can also be used as a mini power bank for emergency (Recommended not to use it as a power bank very often).ConsNot much1. But sometimes automated functions don't work so we have to do them manually.Fix to the cons problemWe can factory reset the buds to remove those problems.And my experience of listening music in crowded place is very good. And the noise isolation they provide is also very good.","This is first TWS after a good research on you tube and on official brand websites.I have been researching about getting a nice TWS earbuds for my everyday use.I wanted a product with great built quality, a decent battery backup and a good sound.The buds are very cool looking with a sleek and stylish recharging case of Active Black color.

"Everything is Good- sound, bass, connectivity, touch sensitivity, noise cancellation, charging, battery, case etc. BUT one thing bothers me. When I put on the earbuds I can do anything, walk, run, eat, drive,jump etc. BUT when lay on bed sideways, the capacitive touch of the earbud touching the pillow gets touched and the earbuds get disconnected. so I put on only left side if I lay on  the right and vice-versa. If only this problem could be solved it would be great because not only me, but everybody loves to watch movies or listen songs or talks over phone while laying on bed.  Otherwise the earbuds are very very good.","Everything is Good- sound, bass, connectivity, touch sensitivity, noise cancellation, charging, battery, case etc. BUT one thing bothers me.

"I bought this product in March. The sound quality, bass was great. They were really comfortable.

The worst part is my product is under warranty but there are not Enough service centers and those that you can find on Boat's official site, half of them don't pick up your phone or are dysfunctional.It's really disappointing to have this problem in such a reputed brand.

"Writing this after 15 days of use.Pros: Fit in the ears is nice. Not bulky that you will have to be constantly guarded that the airpods will fall off.Gets paired easily without much hassels.Battery backup - Used for little over 3 hrs at a stretch and didn't have to put the airpods in the charging box.Cons: Not ideal for calls. The calls get connected but there will be moments when the airpods skip / jump seamless connection. The other end of your caller will ask you to repeat as they missed hearing few words.After 2 to 2.5 hrs of use, your ears drums feel closed as the fit is so perfect deep into the ear canal. Your ears feel the need to breathe. Not all will like using it for more than an hour or so.","Writing this after 15 days of use.Pros: Fit in the ears is nice.

"First off, let me tell you that my primary headphones are Skullcandy Crushers Wireless, so you can just imagine my expectations of ""bass"" and overall sound quality in earphones/headphones; quite honestly, it has spoiled me and ruined all other options as nothing really gets me going like them monsters ( i like my music bassy, without sever compromise on clarity ofcourse).I ordered this for casual use outdoors after a lot of research for bassy earbuds (my first boAt product), and this one popped up consistently in all reviews and suggestions. Having negligible hopes, I was all prepared to be underwhelmed...BUT boy oh boy, I was pleasantly surprised by these, almost a smile on my face in first couple of songs - quite a big  achievement in my books.The bass makes it's presence felt prominently, without severely overshadowing the vocals - so the mids are fairly good; although the highs are a little damp. That being said, the sounds output in general is reasonably clear considering the price point (bang for the buck honestly). If you want neutral sounding earbuds, look elsewhere as these are only going to please people who like their music ""flavored""Take a bow boAt..","First off, let me tell you that my primary headphones are Skullcandy Crushers Wireless, so you can just imagine my expectations of ""bass"" and overall sound quality in earphones/headphones; quite honestly, it has spoiled me and ruined all other options as nothing really gets me going like them monsters ( i like my music bassy, without sever compromise on clarity ofcourse).I ordered this for casual use outdoors after a lot of research for bassy earbuds (my first boAt product), and this one popped up consistently in all reviews and suggestions.

"I frankly had initial reservation while purchasing this product, so no hard feelings. But this proves why products that have a better QA team are always better, which also justifies their higher cost.I have been using this product for 8 months now.1. The sound quality is not good, bass looks artificial, sometime sounding like old cassette tape when it used to get stuck or play slowly.2. The shrillness in the voice is all over the place, no consistency there.3. There is a good lag in sound and voice delivery, the lag is clearly noticeable.4. Within 8 months the upper charging pin of right earbud has got recessed. So the charging is not consistent now.Bottom line, if you can afford to spend more, go for more established brands. Even if you are budget constrained, go for other cheaper brands, as currently the there is absolutely no difference.P.S. this reciew is only for airdopes and not boAt. I have many of their products, and for the money they charged, those gave a satisfactory performance.","I frankly had initial reservation while purchasing this product, so no hard feelings.

"The music sound quality and bass is exceptional for Bluetooth eardbuds under 2500. The bass can be overpowering sometimes though. I got it for 2000 in a lightening deal.The call quality is manageable but not superior as there is distortion on the listening end.It has a type C port,  battery of the buds lasts for about 4 hours in one charge and the case supports about 5 charges.It may seem that there is no battery percentage indicator on the case except for the single light but it actually changes colour according to the percent left.The earbuds are very comfortable and fit in all ear sizes due to the replaceable rubber fans.","The music sound quality and bass is exceptional for Bluetooth eardbuds under 2500.

Noise cancellation is superb in these Airdopes. The bass is also very good. The treble could be improved further but I am happy with the overall output at this price point. It charges quickly & the case looks and feels good. I am comfortable wearing it for about 90 mins at a stretch. Grips well. Good for walking and other workouts but I guess not the best for running/sprinting.,Noise cancellation is superb in these Airdopes. The bass is also very good.

"What I liked about the product is its quality looking at the price range. For this price range, it does a fabulous job. Good bass, sound quality, can receive calls clearly, listen to music, almost everything I expected in this price.What I disliked about the product is its sensors are on the surface of the bud. Everytime I touch it for placing it properly in my ear, the call gets disconnected. Or the video gets paused.  I cannot sleep on my side on my pillow with both earbuds as the sensor touch gets activated and my video is paused. I am using the smallest ear size of the extra buds given. Otherwise it's a gud product.","What I liked about the product is its quality looking at the price range. For this price range, it does a fabulous job.

"Yet another average boat product.This is my 4th boat product and I'm super disappointed that they don't work well with Laptops.In the current scheme of things most people are looking for work-from-home equipments that work well with a standard windows laptop. The audio quality is terrible when using these on calls via MS Teams. The touch is super sensitive and that makes it unviable for workouts and outdoors.

"following are the problems that i am facing after just 1 month of usage:1. The left earbud suddenly stops working. Putting it back in the case won't restart it. No matter how much you try, it won't pair and start. Have to put it outside the case to get it's charge completely drained off and then charge it again. Cannot rely on these for your journeys or even day to day chores.2. The sound gets distorted even when the phone is in your pockets.3. The charge won't last for an entire movie. So you start watching with these eardopes and end with a regular earphone.4. Have to try to get both the eardopes connected to your device in multiple attempts by turning on and off your bluetooth as many times only one side of the eardopes gets connected to the devices.","following are the problems that i am facing after just 1 month of usage:1.

"The sound quality was good.. infact more than I expected.. truly .. bcoz generally with boat products they tend to lean to more bass, however it was not the case here. Maybe due to wireless the base is just correct.. for the price this is unbeatable.. ❤️💗🌼","The sound quality was good.. infact more than I expected.. truly .. bcoz generally with boat products they tend to lean to more bass, however it was not the case here.

"I received this product before the delivery time. That's a plus point. And most of all, it's sound quality is outstanding. I was previously using Realme Buds Q but they were literally a waste of money. When you switch to Airdopes 441, you really get a mesmerizing experience.First of all, talking about its sound quality, it is very very good and It provides a very good bass. Talking about its design, it may seem a little too ordinary regarding the price but it is good. The extra wings on the side of the buds provides a firm grip so they don't dall off easily and do not fall form the ears even while doing heavy exercise. It also provides an IPX 6 rating. Moreover, it comes with a Type C charging case which is a plus point.So, if you're looking for earbuds within a price range of 2000 to 2500, it is the best. Go for it.","I received this product before the delivery time. That's a plus point. And most of all, it's sound quality is outstanding.

"I got this Boat airpod 441 Pro on 15th June & when I used it for my zoom meeting the very first day, suddenly the voice started to have a lots of disturbance in middle of the meeting, then I changed to the other airpod which also went on for a few minutes then it also started to have the same disturbance. After that till next 2 days it was working fine, but now i.e. on 18 June it just didn't connect after taking the airpod (both) out of the box and was not connecting for almost 20-25 minutes, switched in on & off many times so that it would connect immedaite after switching it on, but to my disappointment it Didnt.... After this when I was again trying, it just got unpaired automatically....This is not how an airpod should function. I would rather give Negative to this product.On top of all this, there is error in returning the products and even amazon is not accepting the same & after going through all the IVR chats, this also automatically disconnects and ask to restart on the IVR questions again. Dont expect this from AMAZON.  I would rather term Boat Airpod 441 Pro worst airpod ever.","I got this Boat airpod 441 Pro on 15th June & when I used it for my zoom meeting the very first day, suddenly the voice started to have a lots of disturbance in middle of the meeting, then I changed to the other airpod which also went on for a few minutes then it also started to have the same disturbance.

"Sound quality is good. Could hear nuances of music well. Bass is balanced. Not overpowering, atleast in the songs I heard. Noise cancellation is surprising at the price point, isolates sounds remarkably well. Volume is good and maintains clarity.In call mic volume and quality is also great. Though slightly on the lower side as compared to a wired headphone. Talking a shade louder helps.Definitely recommend.","Sound quality is good. Could hear nuances of music well. Bass is balanced.

"Totally unworthy of its price. I've seen cheaper wired earphones far better than this.- There is always a horrid, loud, running static (Geiger counter-type) noise on both buds. It ruins everything.(and yes, I returned and replaced it, the static problem never goes away)- One of the two buds will randomly stop working for no reason. Even if there is no fault of the user.- If you're on an Android phone, it loves to trigger the Google Assistant and stop whatever you were listening to every few minutes, unless you sit still and motionless.- For all that trouble, you get very average quality of sound at best.Using Boat Airdopes is a painful experience and buying this was a complete waste of money.Don't buy garbage from Boat, go for other earpieces.","Totally unworthy of its price.

But if your product fails 2-3 times within a year and you have to get it replaced remotely and lose almost 2-3 months without using the product what good is the product in the first place?This clearly makes BoAt products highly suceptable to failure within warranty and buying time within Waranty period through the replacement is just simple solution for them.Unreliable and waste of purchase is how I'd put in one line.","Let me tell you this, if you want a decent earphone with decent sound quality and do not worry about warranty and service this is an earphone for you.My scenario,One side of earphone not working within 3 months of purchase.Residing in Chennai and not having a service centre nearby the replacement process has taken more almost a month for me.Warranty says it will replace the device 'n' number of times.

"I got these today in a well packed box and I liked the overall look. The box has cushion inside and package felt premium. Case is also nice and so is the fitting. But unfortunately the most important part, the sound is not the best. And I've given 3 stars purely for build quality.There is a hissing sound in left side piece which is kinda not noticeable when playing music at loud levels but is noticeable in lower volumes. Also it's kinda irritating during calls so I'll be returning them unfortunately. If that was not the case I believe they would have been quite nice.Edit: It got replaced the next day but the new ones have the same problem. Guess it's a flaw in this particular model.  Will try to refund again (idk if it's possible second time, I'm doing this for the very first time). Also now I've changed the ratings from 3 to 2 stars. Disappointed really especially because I actually did require one good earbuds from an indian brand.","I got these today in a well packed box and I liked the overall look.

"First 7 days, the product is awesomeThen things start going a little disturbing, like bluetooth range doesn't work even after 2 mtrs, media volume becomes low, mic volume becomes very disturbing while talking etc. etc.Post return period is over, it starts showing the true colors. Currently, I can't talk while travelling, the other person doesn't understand anything I say. Bluetooth range is less than 1 mtr. With full media volume from my mobile I feel there is very less sound. Talking with this airpods is the worst thing to do during an official call.So overall my suggestion is not to waste your money, better go for JBL atleast they so not compromise on product quality.","First 7 days, the product is awesomeThen things start going a little disturbing, like bluetooth range doesn't work even after 2 mtrs, media volume becomes low, mic volume becomes very disturbing while talking etc. etc.Post return period is over, it starts showing the true colors.

"This product has been a nightmare for me. Even with the usage of just 30-60min a day, it is causing pain in the Ears. It was as if the earplugs were capturing my whole ear. Even after taking out the plugs, you will feel them as if they are still there due to the impressions left by it.This was the first time I tried truly wireless Earphones and I resorted to Neckband type after this bitter experience. I would suggest the buyers to go with Neckband only as it is not feasible in many ways.","This product has been a nightmare for me.

"This product is not Good for calling Purpose , and if you work in public areas it will give a pain in a.... to the person you are talking with . I will give some pros and cons to tell you after my use of 22 days.Pros -1. Good battery life (~ 18-20h)2. Comfortable shape ( of the box) to put in pocket. It’s not bulky3. Good for music in this price range.4. Solid( I have dropped some time but nothing happened)Cons -1. Voice quality on call is not good , people I call complain that is looks like echo sound as if I am in a small room. I compared it with my boult neckband and really it was terrific.2. Noise cancellation is the most disappointing factor, even in cycling the air sound is so much that my voice is not clear ( you can’t hear anything) then forget about bike. I was in canteen and told to my friend to record the call, when I heard it ,I was not  able to get any of my word.3. They are in ear type , So they fit to your ear and seal the ear canal , so I hear my own voice While talking and it’s frustrating, may be it happens to every tws but with this I can’t use both the ear piece. I usually use one of them otherwise I hear my own body movements , I can hear my steps during walk internally .4.no  Volume Adjustment. Though I dint feel any prob with this5. If you are laying down in bed due to the touch by ear your call may disconnect sometime. ( don’t know this is prob or not but it happens with me sometimes)6. When I put back my earpieces back in box one of  the ear piece (left one ) does not start charging some times. I have to adjust it.

"I have been using this product for almost a week. My review is divided into 3 parts. music , calls & Battery life.1) Music: I have noticed that the sound quality is decent. I would say that the bass is not too high as per my previous experience with boat. It's nicely tuned. The lows are nice than they used to be. The high pitch notes are little bassy when you tune your volume little high.2) Calls: Works well for most telephone/whatsapp calls. When I use this for online calls with video conference like Google Meet, the audio starts to crack. I don't think it's a connection issue as I have a pretty fast connection for a household. So the issue could be with the earphones itself. Other than that I don't have any issue with this.3) Charge: Looks decent as of now. On 90% I roughly use it for an hour or two and see that I will have some where around 50-60% left. I haven't tested the full single charge test nor the entire capacity of the charging case as I don't use it continuously. Will update once done.Final verdict. Decent buy as I got it for Rs:1800. Any thing more you might have to look for alternatives.","I have been using this product for almost a week.

"I got this buds delivered two days back and used it to the max to check how much its worth. Below are findings..Pros:1. Sound is pretty good, but i feel the bass is little boosted.2. I like the mic noise cancelling, it cuts the background noise (like air, fan and some little noises), i tried while riding my bike, buds mic catches bike motor sounds. So, perfect for home environment.3. Battery backup was good, it got the full potential of 35mAh in both the buds which long for 4 and half hours4. Box battery 2600mAh can charge buds for more than 20 times.5. Charging time for the buds from Oop’s battery low to full is 1hr 15 minutes.6. These buds cant remember or recognise last paired if you keep changed with devices7. Bluetooth range is good, i connected these to my smart tv and can still listen even though tv is 10 meters away. (Two rooms between)8. Just slips into your pocket, but its a little big. (We should compromise battery life with the size and weight of the box)Cons:1. Yes, there is a buzzy sound in the left bud, which gets a bit low while you are listening something and gets a bit high when you pause the audio.2. Buds are little uncomfortable, they are big for me even with the small size bud caps.3. Buds battery life is fine, but case battery is not as promising as said (150hours approximate 30 charges)4. Keeps disconnecting when i try to connect these to my laptopGot these in sale for ₹2,499","I got this buds delivered two days back and used it to the max to check how much its worth.

"First of all, the sound and bass quality is what you're looking for, then this is not the one. Everything is average. Noise cancellation is not a feature but it does drown out external noise very well. Battery life is amazing and the power bank cum charger is very useful.But......-It loses connection to phone from time to time, one earbud does not work half the time, it's not broken as a simple factory reset will remove these problems but be ready to do that many times.- People with oily ears beware.- all the tws earphones at this price range are same in terms of quality, the power bank is the only redeeming feature.Lower your expectations a lot and this product is really good.","First of all, the sound and bass quality is what you're looking for, then this is not the one.

First of all I would like to say that the speed of dilevery was pretty good and was two delivered 2 days before the promised date. Thumbs up for that👍It is a wonderful product and gives awesome sound quality. The bass is thumping and hence good for bass-lovers...Also the connectivity is very good and it paired with my phone under 20 seconds... It is also very firm once it's in your ear and won't come off easily...Touch sensitivity is also outstanding...Overall good quality plastics are used and it's nice of Boat to include the type-c cable instead of the micro USB...These TWS justify their price...Happy with the earphonesMy rating: 9.7/10,First of all I would like to say that the speed of dilevery was pretty good and was two delivered 2 days before the promised date.

"Never expected this kinda quality in this price!Bought this 3 months ago.Sound quality is really awesome. Even the voice call clarity is great. Sound Effects - No questions! It's Boat, pal. Bass quality is wonderful comparing to other product. Noise cancellation is OK.Battery backup - If we use continuously for listening music or watching movie, it will last for 5 hrs.Charging - Time taking to charge the case upto 3 to 4 hrs and the Airdopes will take less than half an hour to get fully charged when you kept it inside the case.Touch Responsive is superb. Till now working good.The only demerit that I found is, if I use it for long time (above 4 hrs) then my right ear starting to feel a mild pain.So, I'm giving overall rating 4/5.","Never expected this kinda quality in this price!Bought this 3 months ago.Sound quality is really awesome.

"Worst Product!! 😡😡 Don't buy it at all.Usually I don't write any review of the product but this product cost me so much trouble that it is worth mentioning. I brought BOAT AIRDOPES 441 PRO(SPORTY BLUE),the sound in the Right Earpiece got diminished within 10 days of buying the product.So I claimed warranty service from BOAT. They got the product replaced but the procedure is so hectic that it almost took 1 month to get replaced. After using it for another 2-3 months the same problem began to rise but this time in both the earpieces.I got so annoyed that I stopped using the product. After few days I again claimed warranty service( since it of 1 year manufacturer warranty) and the process is still going on.I am surprised that such a terrible product is sold by such a reputed company like BOAT.By the way other features like sound quality,noice cancellation and bass quality is OK and upto the mark.","Worst Product!! 😡😡 Don't buy it at all.Usually I don't write any review of the product but this product cost me so much trouble that it is worth mentioning.

"It's good for phone calls and podcasts but I wouldn't suggest this for music. I've noticed this problem with a few earphones before. The Bass is so much that all the other parts are somewhat muffled. You cannot listen to what the Music Producers actually composed the songs to be like.But the packaging, look and style is very good. It also fits well to your ear.","It's good for phone calls and podcasts but I wouldn't suggest this for music. I've noticed this problem with a few earphones before.

"Bought the Boat 441 Airdopes for ₹1999/- (Prime day Sale)This is my first pair of TWS earbuds, so I dont have anything to compare it with although the following review entails my experience as a user :Pros-1. Noise cancellation is amazing! Active and passive, both.2. The bass quality is really good too, and I found instrumental separation good on listening to some music.Cons-1. Despite changing the earbuds and the wing to the smallest size, it hurts after wearing these airdopes after just half an hour. Ultimately, I removed the wings and that fits much better but makes it more easy to drop these tiny tiny airdopes2. The CTC takes some time to get used to, there's a lag between touching the sensor and the song getting paused/changed.3. My airdopes spontaneously disconnected a number of times.4. (The worst of all) - there's a sort of buzzing noise in the left airdope. I'm sure it must be a problem with mine but it's still disheartening to have spent 2000 rupees on technology that fails you. (I have placed a replace request)All in all, these are a good pair of earphones to own but since it's a very subjective feeling of fit and comfort, you will have to be careful while using them and making the decision whether you like them or not.","Bought the Boat 441 Airdopes for ₹1999/- (Prime day Sale)This is my first pair of TWS earbuds, so I dont have anything to compare it with although the following review entails my experience as a user :Pros-1.

"Everything is perfect except loudness of sound, because bass overshadowed the quality of sound ( mid, low, highs ), and output is 70 % bass, i like the balanced sound of Ptron Urban, though it is far cheaper than boat 441. So if you are bass fan, go for boat 441, otherwise choose another one, which delivers balanced sound like oppo enco w11.

"Very cheap product. Just looks nice, that's it. When it comes to sound, it is just artificial, over powering bass. And I actually like strong bass!However what is worse is the manufacturing defect that quite a few other people have also mentioned - left earbud has a constant hissing / crackling sound. I got a replacement as well which had the same problem!Thanks to Amazon's stellar customer service I was able to return the replacement as well for a full refund.I'm however never buying products from this company.","Very cheap product.

"Review of boAt Airdopes 441 TWS:I had ordered the Airdopes on 29th October, 2020.To be honest the sound was not that good. Also the touch response was laggy.After 2 months,  left ear-drop stopped charging so I registered a complaint. Please note that it took about 15 days to get the product replaced. Also, they don't claim to replace the product with new Airdropes; most of the times it's refurbished.  *Do read their warranty policy before making purchases of any of the Boat's products.To my surprise the sound quality of the replaced unit was better than the previous unit; That means they don't have quality control and every airdrop sounds different.  But obvious the product is made in China.After 10 days of usage again the Airdropes started to sound weird. The sound from the left Airdrop sounded low and muddy; the right one produced buzzing sound when nothing was played.Have initiated the replacement process, but till date haven't received the replacement.I generally never write reviews; but writing this review so that others can make informed decisions while purchasing any of Boat product.After all, it's your money and your decision.Peace!!!","Review of boAt Airdopes 441 TWS:I had ordered the Airdopes on 29th October, 2020.To be honest the sound was not that good.

The sound from the left Airdrop sounded low and muddy; the right one produced buzzing sound when nothing was played.Have initiated the replacement process, but till date haven't received the replacement.I generally never write reviews; but writing this review so that others can make informed decisions while purchasing any of Boat product.After all, it's your money and your decision.Peace!!!",review boat airdope twsi order airdope th october honest sound not good also touch response laggy month leave ear drop stop charge I register complaint please note take day get product replace also not claim replace product new airdrope time refurbish read warranty policy make purchase boat products surprise sound quality replace unit well previous unit mean not quality control every airdrop sound different obvious product make china day usage airdrope start sound weird sound left airdrop sound low muddy right one produce buzzing sound nothing played initiate replacement process till date not receive replacement generally never write review write review make informed decision purchase boat product money decision peace
"So, basically at the starting they seems to be working quite good.1) after 2 weeks, the left earbud started making chhhrrrrr- chhhrrrrrrr sound.2) The noise cancellation is just for fun, because there is no noise cancellation in it and when you talk on a call the person on other side is not able to listen you and you have to disconnect it.3) The ear buds do not fits correctly in the charging case. You have to make the adjustment for ear buds to connect with the case and then charge.4)build quality is just awesome.5) The multi colour lights in it make it look very cheap.6) Literally this one is so Important, Your ears are gonna pain like hell if you wear them more then 20 mins. My ears feels so much pain, seriously This is one of the big problem in it.Now It's your choice. You should buy these or not.😊","So, basically at the starting they seems to be working quite good.1) after 2 weeks, the left earbud started making chhhrrrrr- chhhrrrrrrr sound.2) The noise cancellation is just for fun, because there is no noise cancellation in it and when you talk on a call the person on other side is not able to listen you and you have to disconnect it.3) The ear buds do not fits correctly in the charging case.

"I purchased the Boat 441 airdopes and found them to be a waste of money.First things first, the packaging, the headphones and the charging box look to be of good build and quality. But that's just about as good as it gets.The volume is extremely low, and call quality is bad too with the person on the other end not able to hear anything or hears lots of distortions. The calls audio quality at my end is good (though very low volume).. till about 70% of the total volume, the quality is average and could barely hear.. it gets better at near full volume.The worst part is Amazon does not support return for this product and only offers an exchange.  I will update should my experience be any better with the exchanged product.","I purchased the Boat 441 airdopes and found them to be a waste of money.First things first, the packaging, the headphones and the charging box look to be of good build and quality.

"I bought this CSK edition because I am a huge fan of MSD.The pros are 1. They are portable and fits within a palm2. They give sufficient battery backup to last an entire trip3. They do not get scratched easily and the colour will last4. Excellent customer care service: after 3 months, I asked for exchange because one of the buds was not working so they replaced it within a span of 7-8 days5. It will not fall during heavy workoutThe cons are 1. In my POV, the bass on 90% or 100% seems not to work properly.Giving review after using it for 100 days. May it help other usersI want boAt to make cases and earbuds dedicated to a single person like MSD,VK,SRK,LM10,CR7etc and an football edition too.","I bought this CSK edition because I am a huge fan of MSD.The pros are 1.

"There is a slight disturbing noise in the left ear piece. This noise continues to be there for very long time and stops at its will. Have bought two Airdopes and both of them have the same issue. This persistent noise is so disturbing and annoying , most importantly you can not do any thing about it except switching it off.Overall the product is nice , Great fit , good sound, pocket friendly. But again the disturbing brrrrrrrr noise throws all off all of it.Would suggest to test out the product till the return window is available. I trusted BOAT blindly and bought two of them.

"I'm diehard fan of boat. I have positive opinion after reading review on boat airdopes.I'm writing review after using it 20 days.1.Initially bluetooth connection worked around 5 to 6 meters. Now it is limited max 3 meters. If you move moretham 3 meters from device connection will break.2. Both airdopes are working fine if bluetoothcharging is 100%. Right side dope is not working if the charging is 80%. Battery back up also not coming more than 2 hours.3. Not comfortable to make calls. You have to speak very loudly to reach your voice others. Touch is very sensitive. Even if ear pressure is there, then your call will disconnect. If you adjust airdope when you are on call, call will disconnect for sure.4.audio and bass quality also not good compared to boat rockerz.So please think wisely and don't get suffered after purchased it.","I'm diehard fan of boat.

"This is going to be a detailed review so please read it carefully :I was using my wired earphones and thought of upgrading and so I bought this earbuds during winter sale for rs2000.Pros:-1. The case has a matte finish which looks very good and due to its pebble design it's easy to hold.2. It has a type c port which is helpful as all the smartphones now come with a type c port so you don't have to search your cable again and again.3. The earbuds are completely made up of plastic and so are lightweight.4. The fins on each of the earbud is very helpful as it prevents the buds from falling. I did various exercises and running and they don't fall out.5. Battery life is quite decent on the earbuds. They last upto 3 and 1/2 hours on 60% to 70% volume. The battery backup on the case is really good. I was able to charge the buds 5 times with the case from 0 to 100%.6. The base is very good and punchy which made it sound better.Cons:-1. At this price range they could provide more battery on the buds.2. Due to the small size of the drivers the volume is low. You have to keep it at 70% to listen clearly.3. The sound is not well balanced, it is shifted more towards the base.4. The ears start paining after a long term usage but you will get a hang of it after a while. Also there's an extra fin available which is smaller than the pre installed one so you can switch to it as it's more comfortable (it may depend).5. The hinge on the case is a little bit fragile so use it carefully.6. The product is made in china although boat is a indian brand.At last I would say that at this price range it's a good pair of buds.","This is going to be a detailed review so please read it carefully :I was using my wired earphones and thought of upgrading and so I bought this earbuds during winter sale for rs2000.Pros:-1.

"Pros:1. Super sound. It has Great Bass.2. Noise cancelation is awesome. You can hardly hear surrounding noise when volume is at higher side.3. Fits perfectly in the ear.4. Looks premium.5. Connecting with phone is flawless and also pause, play, next song option on earpod is great.Cons:1. My left earpod had some tingling noise when video is playing but volume is low or zero.

"First Of all i am a big fan of boAt product its well known for good sound & bass. The product is really awesome in terms of build quality, sound & noise cancellation. Even the touch response is so superb you dont have to pull your phone continuously From your pocket for changing the songs.About the battery it's pretty much better as its Atlast for 3.30 hours of continuous usage.The major feature is the bluetooth connectivity where you need not wait for pairing each time ,once Bluetooth switched on it automatically connects.!!!Overall i am really happy for this product & It’s really value for money also.","First Of all i am a big fan of boAt product its well known for good sound & bass.

"Giving review after 10 days of using. Nice product. Battery life is awesome 🤩 but using only one airdope and replacing other 😅 over a time. No volume control 😠. Touch is so sensitive as just a slight touch will end the call which makes us feel uncomfortable. Excellent for gaming any kind of games especially for PUBG lovers 😍. Material used for airpodes is so nice as accidentally I dropped by airpode from 1st floor to ground floor which directly fallen on the Road, but aftet using it it worked nicely no problem in hearing and no scratches and no cracks which makes me happy about airdopes. 2600 mah battery is so nice which makes us to take any were going out not bothering about of charging and current cuts. For music lovers also it is so good with good bass but not excellent. If u are music lover and listen most of the time they are excellent as they give more battery life by managing the airpodes using two for some time and keeping one airpode for charging. Overall it is very good product with excellent battery life, Good bass, Good Long range bluetooth connection, Very good quality of product. But only problem is No volume control 🙄😡.","Giving review after 10 days of using. Nice product. Battery life is awesome 🤩 but using only one airdope and replacing other 😅 over a time.

i Got the headphones just as an alternative to my bose Sound sports of course i am probably comparing them to those but the volume in these headsets are just not there .. There are times that i go for long cycling rides and i require more than a pair of wireless headsets to keep me going for longer so as a secondary i bought these. The build is obviously cheap and not that great i recommend if you can spend a little more to go in for the Jabra Elite 65t @ 5999 they are a 100 times better and almost the same quality as the bose .. so make your choice 3k more for the jabra..,i Got the headphones just as an alternative to my bose Sound sports of course i am probably comparing them to those but the volume in these headsets are just not there ..

Given 4 star as fell from my balcony at 18floor and working 😂. Otherwise just an okay product. Sound quality just okay not impressive.

"The bass quality is awesome. The sound is too good for this price range and we can feel each and every beat.

(PS: THIS CAN BE ROMOVED IF WE WANT). Apart from this, these earbuds are worth for money.. Just go for it.","The bass quality is awesome.

Got it in prime day at 1799.Cons : my ears are small, so it doesn't fit in properly, but however it fits now, whatever i do, it doesn't drop, testing jumping, running, skipping many times.One more is, the silicon buds pack your ear and creates pressure in your ear which will feel somewhat uncomfortable after few mins of wearing. The case cap is a bit loose, but you can live with it.Rest i found it worth the money. Sound is amazing, no hissing sound, crystal clear when nothing is playing.

Even though the product is worth the money but I would to address this particular issue with Airdopes 441 & 441 pro series that one of the bud will either stop charging after a couple uses or it will stop holding enough charge to run for long periods.If they can come up with a good solution to this it will be the best choice in the price range.I have been using the 441 for over a year now but due to the above mentioned problem I had to buy the new ones the 441 pro but to my dismay they also had the same problem just after using for 2 days.If the problem continues I might think of changing my preferences and moving on to find a product that is worth the money I am paying.,Even though the product is worth the money but I would to address this particular issue with Airdopes 441 & 441 pro series that one of the bud will either stop charging after a couple uses or it will stop holding enough charge to run for long periods.If they can come up with a good solution to this it will be the best choice in the price range.I have been using the 441 for over a year now but due to the above mentioned problem I had to buy the new ones the 441 pro but to my dismay they also had the same problem just after using for 2 days.If the problem continues I might think of changing my preferences and moving on to find a product that is worth the money I am paying.,even though product worth money I would address particular issue airdope pro series one bud either stop charge couple use stop hold enough charge run long periods come good solution good choice price range use year due mention problem I buy new one pro dismay also problem use days problem continue I might think change preference move find product worth money I pay

"Bought this device in July 2020, when the first lockdown restrictions were lifted and wasn't disappointed. For the price, this device is a god-send and does its job wonderfully. However stressing the device like taking it outdoors for a walk constantly , hampers it so I had to replace the product via warranty 8 months later.Removing 2 stars for the lack of durability; apart from this, it is a perfect device that is from a valuable Indian brand and has superb warranty and sound quality. Just see videos on how to clean TWS earphones and cases clearly as this will help in maintaining the device for a long time.

"Rather difficult to handle and use.  Not very easy on the ear since I felt uneasiness after a few minutes. I have no other brand for comparison and perhaps things will improve as the days go by.

"Hi, I am really not a big fan of writing reviews in any e-commerce websites. But after spent lots of time & search I thought I can buy this TWS which comes under my budget. Opened this TWS package with a lot of excitement. Oops... To be frank I am not disappointed with music. The bass and vocal is very clear. But the problem comes only when you try to voice command. As per the instruction we need to hold for 2 secs for voice command. So when I do this that's it. My iphone completely hangs and I cannot open any apps. It won't access hey siri voice command at all. I have to manually close my phone and have to open again which is really really disappointing. I would have agree if this could happen with some unknown brand TWS. But with boAt I am completely pissed off. So I have returned my item on the very first and asked for replacement hoping that this could work with new item. But it happened again. Hence I decided have to live with this without voice command option.I used to listen songs during my leisure time. So from sound point of view this is still TWS to buy.

"- The Right Earphone stopped functioning completely - It stopped charging, no audio is coming from it, I have done multiple factory resets as mentioned on the manual, to no avail. While it worked amazing and I have no had any issues with it for the past 3 weeks, now I can only use one earphone and there is no fix to the issue, multiple people are facing the issue with these earphones when I looked online and there is no fix for it, it just happens suddenly and there is nothing you can do about it. I live in the US and bought these in India right before leaving. The mic was also disappointing as many complained they couldn't hear me.

"This is my first time using any Earpods. I've seen the reviews saying it's average quality but still wanted to give it a try.I am giving this review after using it for 5 days-LOOKS- This has a plastic body which is expected in this price range. Overall it looks good, neither cheap nor expensive.SOUND- Bass is very good. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THAT IT HAS A BUZZING SOUND IN THE LEFT EARBUD! you can't notice it while listening to something but if the music stops this sound can be pretty irritating. Otherwise sound quality is good.NOISE CANCELLATION- Its noise cancelling ability is average.CALL FEATURE- If you're in your home it can work pretty well but outdoors the other person can't hear you properly because the mic catches the surrounding sounds.CONTROLS- The feather touch works well but if you accidentally touch it the music can stop or the call can disconnect. But you can manage after few days of using it.BATTERY- The left earpod is not getting charged!!!! It is always on battery low!In short, these pair of airdopes is doing well in the given price range (below 2K). I got this for ₹1699 in Sporty Blue colour and I'm satisfied with the product.","This is my first time using any Earpods.

It's not of good quality. As boat products are good so I bought this but really disappointed. There is no audio while in a voice call or laptop meetings. I had disconnect it and switch to phone audio for the other person to hear me. I complained was but the person suggested to go for factory reset. When I asked it this problem going to occure frequently she was hesitant to reply and suggested for rest everytime I faced this. And now afte almost one month the problem remaons yhe same and above that while listening songs frequently the audio goes off in one or the other bud and keeps on shifting from one to another.,It's not of good quality.

During initial days of usage it will be good.

"I had excitedly purchased boat Airpods for myself as a birthday gift to find the product perfect for my use.Gradually a screeching sound started in the device and it kept increasing.

I have been a boat user from past couple years and have got multiple boat accessories but these airdopes disappointed me a lot. The left earbud stopped working even before a month all the money down the drain. I seriously did not expected this from boat.I  would definitely recommend boat but not this specific product. I wanted to claim the warranty but for that I need to visit some weird place to get it fixed up. This process is so disappointing I expect so much better from boat atleast a way where I do not have to physically go out in this COVID situation and waste my time on getting this fixed up it should be the responsibility on the vendors end rather than the customer.

I would like brief u about my review with detailed explanation context wise. So we start with Pros(advantage) then cons(disadvantages) And lastly conclusion.Also features about buds..like battery life is all given in description by company 👍 I won't type the manual here again.. I shall give opinion according to my own experience.💯Everything is MY personal point of view.PROS:1. Beautiful colour. I purchased yellow colour which is very vibrant n good looking.2. The sound quality is good and bass as usual is very strong 💯 If u r loyal boat customer.3. Instantly pairs up with ur device via bluetooth. I use One Plus nord.4. Has good sensor touch buttons n gestures for controlling features during music.5. Comes with several different shape n size of buds allowing u to customise according to ur ear shape and is very comfortable.6. I use it during immense workout and is good sweat resistant and Nothing happens if sweat comes in contact with buds.7. Full charge within 2 hours. Very compact..fits in pocket easily.CONS:1. They are a little loose for my ear and left one falls off quite easily but i can be resolved by using correct size of buds.2. After a month or so.. when u use the buds suddenly one of the bud stops working like battery drains abruptly or one doesn't work(goes Silent) after removing from case.3. The buds together don't charge properly and most of times one of them is left out..so while putting buds in case make sure u see both green light on buds only then close it for charging.4. The touch sensor is very sensitive sometimes only few hairs touch n song pauses.CONCLUSION:The product seems a little more than reasonable price but that's alright according to the performance given by the buds. Happy with product and suggest to buy on ur own call because the product is MADE IN CHINA.. so buy it accordingly 👍,I would like brief u about my review with detailed explanation context wise.

"The product has a really good sound quality and durability (minimal noise cancellation as ANC products start around 5-6k). When gaming, there can be a lag in mili seconds if your device doesn't have a good ram, but this is the case with even the most expensive wireless headsets.There is one slight problem. Me and many of my friends bought this product and everyone's earbuds(one of them) got malfunctioned in a couple of months, so that may be a slight issue. But warranty claim is really good, they picked up and delivered back all of us new earbuds (both earbuds replaced not refurbished), and since then it has been 7 months and there has been no issue.Tip:- Do not buy Airdopes 441 but instead, buy Airdopes 441 Pro.","The product has a really good sound quality and durability (minimal noise cancellation as ANC products start around 5-6k).

"I just got one question for the manufacturer. Do you test the each product before sell it to your customers? This earbuds have problems in connection with phone when you are on call, any normal or whatsapp. It gets disconnected and reconnect again in like 12 secs but the occurrence of this is very frequent like every 3rd minute when you are on call.I have refunded my amount after 1 attempt of replacement. Same does my friend who bought this earbuds on my referal.Though it's a major issue I want to appreciate sound quality is really good so is the noise cancellation. You can't hear anything if you are on speaker mode. You will have to remove one Earbud to listen. Bass quality is also good.I use to admire boAt before this order.","I just got one question for the manufacturer. Do you test the each product before sell it to your customers?

"I bought this product a couple months back, and did face a minor issue in connection. Well, I raised a complaint with the boAt team, and guess what, got an instant reply. The same day they picked my product, and told me they'll provide me with a replacement. Well, that was quick, but my replacement product arrived after literally a month and this time, they sent me a used and old product with a different color. The product was full of scratches and shabby looking. I did raise a complaint again, same response and they literally sent me back the same old used product. After that, they stopped replying to my mail and on call, they say they'll get in 48 hours, and they never have. I am utterly disappointed by the customer service they are offering. I even requested for the same product back, which I had initially raised complaint for, which as well is not going to come back.

"It's a great product by Boat Industry in this price range. I am very choosy in my headphones. I have used many wired and Bluetooth devices. I too have Zabra lite, OnePlus Buds, but in comparison to the price range, it's unbeatable. The clarity and bass is excellent. It has also nice grips to hold with the ears. Does not seem to be painful for longer usage.","It's a great product by Boat Industry in this price range. I am very choosy in my headphones. I have used many wired and Bluetooth devices.

There is no original packing, cable, instruction manual etc. I received just the headphones in a small courier cover! Pic is attached.

"I've been using boAt Bassheads for past 2 years and quite satisfied with it, so I naturally I've to go with boAt TWS airdopes. I bought them during prime day sale for ₹1999. Coming to point, If you are a bass lover, then just buy them, look nowhere else. But if you enjoy solace, and listen to podcasts and voice content, then you can seek some other TWS. I won't recommend buying 441 pro since there's hardly any difference between both, even driver size of 6mm is same. With remaining ₹500, just buy a 10000 mAh power bank which can charge both your phone and charging case. Sometimes there's connectivity problem, which can easily be corrected by factory resetting them.","I've been using boAt Bassheads for past 2 years and quite satisfied with it, so I naturally I've to go with boAt TWS airdopes.

"Had pairing issues. They just wouldn’t pair. Factory reset was hard to perform and even after reset had pairing issues. Only the left ear bud was working even after multiple factory resets. So returned the item. And ordered a fresh pair.On receiving a fresh pair I noticed the packaging was different. There was a thin plastic wrapping all around the box. Also the tapes on the sides of the box had boat logo. None of this was there on the earlier box.So I suspect that the box was either tampered with, or it was a used piece or it was a fake boat product.The new pair of earbuds paired instantly. A detailed review on the fresh pair will be posted separately.","Had pairing issues. They just wouldn’t pair. Factory reset was hard to perform and even after reset had pairing issues.

Sound/bass quality is excellent considering the price.Usability is pathetic. The capacitive  touch on the outer side is very sensitive when it doesn’t need to be; I accidentally hit it and pause my music/book/podcast so many times when I’m just trying to adjust them in my ear.And other times it’s completely unresponsive like when I’m trying to turn them off. I keep holding for 5-10 seconds and nothing happens.These would have been the best earphones in their price category had they simply been given buttons instead of this capacitive touch non-sense. They are beautiful sounding but very hard (almost impossible) to use.I ordered 2 of them and they both have the exact same sensitivity issue.,Sound/bass quality is excellent considering the price.Usability is pathetic.

"Do they at least test the product before marketing them? How can people be this irresponsible? I'm pretty sure no developer/tester or any one from boAt tested this product like a real user. Touch sensor is horrible. It's not designed to handle accidental touches. If they only tested this product with phone calls, they would have found it. Seriously man a whole company is irresponsible. This is a basic thing. I can't even adjust the buds when I'm on a call or listening to something. It disconnects the call suddenly (Because I ADJUSTED THE BUDS!!!). It's not easy to put it on without touching the sensor, they should have fixed that issue. Okay I can resist myself from adjusting it during calls, but if the buds are on the table, I can't even take them without touching the sensor, it connects the call before I'm ready. and the worst thing is, this happens only when I put the first bud, you know what happens if I take the second bud and put it on? It disconnects the call. BECAUSE I ACCIDENTALLY TOUCHED THE SENSOR....  Wow.... What a product, what a team and what a management. How did they even approve this product?

"Not worth it, I bought it for 2.5k. It has been 2 months since i bought it. It is only comfortable for large ears individuals, mine are medium so after wearing for sometime it starts hurting, it doesn't even fit properly in my ear.The sound in fine, or better than fine. The bass is thumpy, the trebles are also good.Their touch control even when touched to the wall or even the pillow when pressed hard.But after one month i accidentally dropped the left piece from waist hieght. Now the left one's sound is unbearable,(badluck). I still kept them using, ignoring the left one, but now i can't hear from the left piece. I used the warranty given and it will take 1 month for whole process.So its not worth the price paid.You can go for Boult audio propods (or name something like that). They have the same price.","Not worth it, I bought it for 2.5k. It has been 2 months since i bought it.

Simply too good...I already bought a Boat airdopes 441 Pro during Amazon Prime day and was quite happy with my buy...The next day I ordered a  Boat airdopes 441. I was happily shocked to see it. It was a much more smaller box than the 441 Pro...I wonder how they managed to put 400 mAh into it...Anyway I hope both last me a year or two...I have other Boat products with which I am very happy till date,Simply too good...I already bought a Boat airdopes 441 Pro during Amazon Prime day and was quite happy with my buy...The next day I ordered a  Boat airdopes 441.

"These bassheads are bang on delvering their primary task - Sound Quality. Bass heads, rejoice. The bass out of them is deep, really deep. No issues found in mids and highs. No distortion at full volume. Good at blocking outside noise as well. Only concern is build quality of case and the eardopes. The hinge on the case looks weak, I doubt they would last long if not handled carefully. Getting they earphones out of them is quite tricky, still trying to figure best way to get them out without dropping them from my hands.","These bassheads are bang on delvering their primary task - Sound Quality.

Bad: Bass is ok but shallow. You won't get the punchy feeling (comparing it with Sony MDR xb50). The bass makes mid tone wash off which is really annoying. You actually lose quality because of this.Good: good battery life and connectivity. Case is big but with that battery power you are good to go for a long time without charging.,Bad: Bass is ok but shallow. You won't get the punchy feeling (comparing it with Sony MDR xb50).

Bought this product little over a month ago as an anniversary gift for my husband. He just tried it today and the battery gave up in 2 hours even with full charge AND the sound kept going in and out.We called Amazon and they denied from returning.

It was a waste of money for me and my husband wasn’t very happy about this product or service.,Bought this product little over a month ago as an anniversary gift for my husband.

So sound quality and bass are all okay okay (doable) but what really strikes me off is it's useless if you are a Mac user. It totally ruined my experience as my most of the time spent in front of my working station but it's useless and keeps disconnecting as soon as I try to connect them. And now I can't even Return them (there's only replacement option😫).So all my money is wasted on this useless air dopes....really super bad experience and it's my first day and I am writing this review.

I was using Boat Rockers 255 for long time and have a lot of commuting on two wheeler due to my work profile.They were the best thing in my life. Each year December I would get 1 new pair and give away the old pair to my office staff members. This year sadly right ear piece sotopped working. So I decided to upgrade from 255 to 441 true wireless. Have used them for not more than 6 hrs... In which I got 6 to 7 calls during commute. Each person had only one response.... Please remove the Bluetooth and talk over the phone.... So.... I had to stop on the side of the road each time to be able to talk to my clients/family/friends.... Which clearly looses the first point of using a Bluetooth on the go.P.S I ordered 1st pair on Prime day sale day 1. & In 2 hrs approximately the price of the Bluetooth decreased from 2499 to 1999.... Which is a staggering 500 INR. So I cancelled the order and purchased again in the new deal.So all in all I would suggest please buy if you have a personal Car or a closed cabin office to talk to people else the recipient of the call will just be irritated,I was using Boat Rockers 255 for long time and have a lot of commuting on two wheeler due to my work profile.They were the best thing in my life.

"Sound Quality was good and Bass was very good, using it for music, movies and calls. One small draw back is during calls you need to speak louder on Airdopes compared to regular phone. I’m able to use it for both laptop and mobile, connectivity is easy and fast. Initially had issues with volume after doing factory reset couple of times it’s working perfectly brought it on launch day till now charged the case only once very good battery backup.","Sound Quality was good and Bass was very good, using it for music, movies and calls.

"The airbuds are nice. Best feature is battery backup of the case and mono use. Connection to phone is pretty fast. Just take some time to get used to touch functionality. Not the best when it comes to voice call, the listener keep complaining of low sound specially when you are outside, but i found if you hold the right bud as a microphone near your mouth, it solves that problem.","The airbuds are nice.

"The sound quality of the product is good, the bass quality is also decent and the overall performance is quite satisfactory.  The noise cancellation of this product is below average because the person on the other end would listen all the background noises very clearly rather than your voice.Before Buying read it very carefully, the Service is really Pathetic! You would be cheated for sure, this is because this is the 2nd time am facing the issue with BOAT company. For this product, first within a few months it stopped connecting to my devices, when I raised a complaint for warranty repair, they sent me a different Color Airdopes with a lot of scratches and especially a used one. Originally I was having a red Airdopes 441 but after warranty replacement they sent me a black one with used and scratched condition. Infact, it also have some sound problems. Now they have stopped entertaining my issues, even if I raise a complaint, they ignore it. Also worst customer care ever, as the person sitting on the other end has only one job, that is to escalate the ticket, that’s it. So as I said, it’s happening for the second time with me, my personal experience with BOAT company is really bad. Buy BOAT products and just hope it stays well throughout or else you would be in this useless customer service trap.","The sound quality of the product is good, the bass quality is also decent and the overall performance is quite satisfactory.

When u dont play the music or a muted scene in use they make hissing sound which is sometimes uncomfortableNoise cancellation is not bad but active noise cancellation is not up to the mark as compared to Boat products. Could have been little betterBass is nice for 6mm driverBest advantage of the pro model is 2450 mah case which can be used as an emergency power bank it has support for usb port which can be used to charge your mobile.Can be used to play games as well no latency the sound is very goodGood product if u are thinking to buy a neckband well u can give this a try as well. Amazon has 10-30 days replacement scheme so you can try compare and return which ever suites you. My personal choice would be this because of the battery backup.,When u dont play the music or a muted scene in use they make hissing sound which is sometimes uncomfortableNoise cancellation is not bad but active noise cancellation is not up to the mark as compared to Boat products.

"I'm really happy with my purchase. For this rate, I've had a great experience with the dopes. Battery lasts. Music quality is really good. Problem arises if you're talking to someone when on a call, it picks up ambient noise over your own voice, so can't use for calls especially if you're out somewhere. Also after a year, the left dope stopped working as well. I mean the voice is louder on the right one. So overall I'm happy because for 2k I got these to last an entire year, having used it everyday!","I'm really happy with my purchase. For this rate, I've had a great experience with the dopes.

Four things to consider1. There is no noise cancellation - Surrounding sounds are clearly audible than our voice.2. The touch button is very sensitive - can be easily mistouched.3.

Connectivity is too quick. Calls are clear and audible. Bluetooth range is also good. No loss of connection untill 10m range(i tried moving into next room, nd can still hold the connection). Case is small and compact than what I expected and I like it. At first had a issue in connecting it with mobile. It takes tym to understand how to connect, but once it's connected, then it's a cake walk. Got it fr 2500 and pretty happy with it. No static noise on left bud or either buds as some mentioned earlier.","Delivered on 10,and today is 18.i haven't charged it from past 1week, still its showing 2points of battery remaining.

"Review Updates: See upto last.I was very confused before buying this. I have researched like Mad. I wanted to final Boult True Bass TWS eadpods as it has very good performance. I was hesitating before buying this Boat Airdopes 441 as It has both positive and negative reviews here. Some are saying it is good while others are saying this is very bad. But I finally dare to buy this. I was very worried about mic performance but at indoor mic quality is good. Faced no problem with mic at indoor but haven't tried it at outdoors. Bass quality is good too.. overall v.good sound quality. But I have Expected More from it. I thought I will get Totally different experience than wired earphones but I must say I was wrong. My Realme buds 2 (Rs 599) is equally good or better I would say..I just hope it don't get worse after use. It is so delicate to use. And I am always in fear that one bud either right or left will stop working some day in day to day use. The case is small, funky, sexy and delicate so be careful.I am using it from 2 days And I just Hope It will last long for years and I don't have to claim warranty inbetween as I don't want this airdopes to stop working like here people say in their review.I will update my review after a month of using it. Let's just hope It works well and I hope I don't get any problems here otherwise it will waste of Rs 2000. Fingers crossed🤞🏻. For now I would say yes Go for it👍🏻Update:After 3 days of use: Battery backup seems just ok. 10% battery down in just 15 mins of music. Each our 20-30% battery drain seems battery is not that promising as advertised like 5hrs on single charge. Now facing bad call quality indoors too. If I speak normal or loudly it is audible to other side. Slightly lower voice or regular sound isn't audible on other side during call. Battery backup poor.","Review Updates: See upto last.I was very confused before buying this. I have researched like Mad. I wanted to final Boult True Bass TWS eadpods as it has very good performance.

It’s been almost a year now since i bought this. It’s fine in the beginning. You get decent sound quality but as the time progresses issues arises especially with the left side. The volume from left is hardly noticeable. It happened multiple times throughout the year. It gets fixed on its own and then back. The battery backup is around 1.5hrs when maxed then it needs to charge. Now the buds slips out of my ear and also started to hurt while using. Not a good wholesome experience with these earphones.,It’s been almost a year now since i bought this. It’s fine in the beginning.

the sound quality is better than most brands in this budget....the charging case has a very long battery life as told on box....but treble side of the sound is a bit weak not so much that can be problematic to any one..still a very nice pair of buds and has a really good fitment and has a really comfortable inear experience...in the end its a product u can look forward to buy.,the sound quality is better than most brands in this budget....the charging case has a very long battery life as told on box....but treble side of the sound is a bit weak not so much that can be problematic to any one..still a very nice pair of buds and has a really good fitment and has a really comfortable inear experience...in the end its a product u can look forward to buy.,sound quality well brand budget charging case long battery life tell box treble side sound bit weak not much problematic one still nice pair bud really good fitment really comfortable inear experience end product u look forward buy

"Sound quality is pretty good but I'm not a basshead and so I had to fiddle through my EQ to adjust that migraine-inducing throb that came with the Airdope's overdone bass. Noise cancellation doesn't really deserve a mention. It feels like you've got a pair of rubber tip buds in your ear. That's about it. The mics are too sensitive to the point of being almost unusable for a lot of calls unless you're in a windowless room and nowhere near a spinning fan. The touch sensitive buttons are overly sensitive and the response is extremely delayed to the point of annoyance. I'd tap the button and wait for a good whole second to know whether my music is about to be paused or not. Also, the bluetooth range is a joke once you leave the room without your phone.Fortunately, I didn't expect a lot from 2000 rupee earphones. I just needed a pair of buds that would give me some ambient music when I'm on the move and wouldn't fall out of my ears easily. The Airdopes 441 obtains passing marks for the ambient music once I fixed the EQ. And it obtains 5/5 for a snug fit. No matter what I did, the buds refused to fall out of my ears despite some rigorous and unrealistic conditions.OverallAudio: 2/5Mic: 1/5Connectivity: 2/5Interface: 1/5Fit: 5/5Design 4/5","Sound quality is pretty good but I'm not a basshead and so I had to fiddle through my EQ to adjust that migraine-inducing throb that came with the Airdope's overdone bass.

"The sound quality of these TWS is really impressive and bass is just perfect.For connectivity there is IWP (Instant wake and pair technology) in it, which connects the TWS to your Mobile very quickly.And it also has Fast pair technology (by google) too.The CTC (Capacitive touch control) works properly, there is not much delay in response.I think if you want to buy a TWS in budget segment, then this is the best TWS for you.The only con that I found in these TWS is that you can not control the volume of the bluetooth device by the touch control, you have to reach your smartphone and then you can control it from volume button of your phone.This is a 5 star product in my opinion. Go for it👍🏻⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐","The sound quality of these TWS is really impressive and bass is just perfect.For connectivity there is IWP (Instant wake and pair technology) in it, which connects the TWS to your Mobile very quickly.And it also has Fast pair technology (by google) too.The CTC (Capacitive touch control) works properly, there is not much delay in response.I think if you want to buy a TWS in budget segment, then this is the best TWS for you.The only con that I found in these TWS is that you can not control the volume of the bluetooth device by the touch control, you have to reach your smartphone and then you can control it from volume button of your phone.This is a 5 star product in my opinion.

"I just love this airdopes 441, you get a kind of  noise cancellation without any noise cancellation feature you just have to select the perfet earbud tip size for yourself and its a game of vaccum. At almost 50 to 60% volume they sound great u can increase it according to you… some might face a problem while using it for the first time those who just changed to wireless buds from wired earphone as i said u just have to choose proper size of earbud tip and that ear wings/flag. As mentioned by some YouTube review while whatsapp calling or any internet calling you can hear the person you are talking to but your voice slightly reaches him/her in low volume, on normal call it sounds normal as you are talking on your mobile it self after all its wireless. The design is great it fits properly after using proper siz budtip , i loved those rgb lights , the touch response is a very little bit slow almost half sec delay u can feel when u pause or play a song. Other than that this are very good tws earbuds. If you want great sound quality , great Bass quality you can blindly go for this ones .","I just love this airdopes 441, you get a kind of  noise cancellation without any noise cancellation feature you just have to select the perfet earbud tip size for yourself and its a game of vaccum. At almost 50 to 60% volume they sound great u can increase it according to you… some might face a problem while using it for the first time those who just changed to wireless buds from wired earphone as i said u just have to choose proper size of earbud tip and that ear wings/flag. As mentioned by some YouTube review while whatsapp calling or any internet calling you can hear the person you are talking to but your voice slightly reaches him/her in low volume, on normal call it sounds normal as you are talking on your mobile it self after all its wireless. The design is great it fits properly after using proper siz budtip , i loved those rgb lights , the touch response is a very little bit slow almost half sec delay u can feel when u pause or play a song. Other than that this are very good tws earbuds.

"After searching multiple earbuds, I found this one. Even when you put these without music, I hardly can hear anything from the surrounding which is great. The earbuds are great with bass and overall quality and volume. Being a music lover at the gym , I keep the volume at 80% and it's amazing. The best earbuds within this budget. If you're worried about the trebles because of the bass, i felt the trebles are great. 😍","After searching multiple earbuds, I found this one.

"The initial experience was good. Thought its a value for cost, however, two weeks, in the pods are completely useless for use in calls. When calling on whatsapp, the bluetooth would drop often. Tried with other bluetooth headphoens and earphones and all worked well, but these pods never made it until the end of the call. Has good charging , but whats the point, never got to recharge and stopped using these pods. After a week, i trashed the packaging, and now i am repenting. Cant return, waste of money and a bad experience with boAt as a brand.","The initial experience was good.

"First of all, the main concern for me is the Sound Quality. I am a DJ, always prefer to play & listen natural & neutral sounds.

Good for them who love artificially extra bass.Battery backup is good as company claim upto 5 hours.Found smaller Fin is more comfortable which comes with the Earbuds in the box.","First of all, the main concern for me is the Sound Quality.

"I've been a JBL user for a long time. For the first time I'm using boat and I'm okay with it.

If you even slightly adjust them in ear while u are on call. Your call will disconnect. You voice sounds Heavy than normal . Also not very much comfortable in ear. It starts paining. Heavy weight. All together not satisfied as did not fulfill my requirements. I Would go for good range and good brand.,Not good for calls. If your purpose is calling then Not recommended.

"Bass is to my liking. Good for listening to music. Battery back up is 3-4 hours on single charge. The big charging case is absolutely great, lasts for around 15-20 days. Noise cancellation is not that good. Sometimes people are not able to hear my voice clearly citing low audio. Got it for Rs. 2499, so at that price point its satisfactory. Overall a nice product. Go for it if you are a bass lover and looking for wireless earbuds.Got the product replaced after 10 months (in Jun'21) as one of the earbuds was not working. The replaced product too is facing the same problem (Dec'21). I am just disappointed.","Bass is to my liking. Good for listening to music. Battery back up is 3-4 hours on single charge.

"After seeing lots of videos on YouTube and reviews - We ordered this product. But to be honest, we didn't like it much. Once you put it in your ears, it creates a vacuum and start hurting your ears within 15-20 minutes. Sound quality is just average. The only plus point is the battery backup. Also the left side ear bud doesn't fit properly inside the case and sometimes don't get charged even after having a magnetic hold. We use it in GYM and it doesn't fall from your ear. But if your trainer/friend speaks to you, you have to take it off from your ear to listen.","After seeing lots of videos on YouTube and reviews - We ordered this product.

"My OnePlus buds abruptly stopped working, and without any service centres in my location I decided to buy a new one with a comparatively lower investment. Then I got a pair of Boat Buds (Masaba Edition).Pros: Packaging, Sound Quality, Comfort, Case, BassCons: Touch sensor. If you accidentally tap the touch area, the surface is so sensitive that it reacts instantaneously without even applying any pressure. You've to handle the buds like nuclear weapons if you don't want to accidentally play/pause your music, movie, series etc.","My OnePlus buds abruptly stopped working, and without any service centres in my location I decided to buy a new one with a comparatively lower investment.

"There is issue with left Ear TWS airdope. The sound cracks on high volume & battery of left TWS drains much earlier than right TWS.I got 1st package with multiple issues like frequent bluetooth disconnections while voice calls, cracking noise in left airdope, battery drainage of left airdope. Even the Airdopes were not getting auto disconnected after putting them in case.I called for replacement & fortunately the seller sent me the replacement much earlier.The sound & bass quality of this 441 Airdope is better with its 6 MM driver than Realme Q 10 MM driver eardopes.In my opinion, its better to listen this TWS around 60-70% volume to avoid cracking sound.

"The boat airdopes are totally worth the money. Sound quality is excellent. Bass is also very good. I bought this 3 months ago and it still has no issues. I have accidentally dropped the airdopes from my hands and no damage is seen as the build quality is also very good.

Plus you need to push the earbud deep inside your ear to fit in, which makes you completely deaf. You can't hear anything of the outside world.

"Overall Sound Quality is very good and Bass is great as well. The only problem I faced and what I think made my review lose two stars is the Mic. The mic works well in phones but does not work with a computer. Even though it displays connected for voice. I have tested other boat airdopes, they work perfectly fine. I have also tested other companies TWS earphones. They also work fine. I have also checked all possible settings on my computer ( Windows). I also tried using them with Linux. None of my efforts worked. I even replaced my order from amazon, thinking there might be a defect in my particular piece. That was also not the case. There is some problem with the model itself. I hope Boat wold see this review and check the product.","Overall Sound Quality is very good and Bass is great as well.

Good product. Works well. Blue Tooth Pairing is fast. Only problem is that it can make hearing sounds around you difficult to hear. Battery life is ok. One interesting thing is two people can listen at the same time by using one bud each 😀,Good product. Works well. Blue Tooth Pairing is fast.

"These 441 pro worth the price. The Sound is Good & Clear and the bass, just killing. The built quality of case and buds is neat. I am using this since Jan'21 and it's almost 1 year.

They replaced my product and it reached for me on the 5th day from the day they picked up. Right now it's working perfectly and I almost accidentally slipped the new earbuds almost 3 times from several height. It doesn't failed to impress!","These 441 pro worth the price.

They are good enough to listen to music. The sound is OK for the price they won't blow your mind away. The bass is too much for someone who owns a better pair of headphones and it perfectly fine for someone who doesn't care about how their music sounds. It is what you pay for. But.....

This is my honest review.So i ordered this product on 22nd october and the earbuds I recd had some fault the left earbud was continuously producing unwanted sound with a small input which was frustrating and even more difficult to watch movies.

When u order replacement they send u a even more defective product than the first one and even may be a used one. Plus they were very uncomfortable your ears will hurt.So dont order this even by mistake don't just go by its appearance bcz of light stuff n all it is a pathetic product and not happy with Amazon service too.

"This product was got in ₹1999 on Amazon Great Indian sale and its pathetic. First the earbuds are not made for Indian ears. Sony earphones are far far better in ergonomics.Got it because I had used Boat Rockers 700 headphones earlier and they were pretty good. These ones are pathetic.Also its not even water resistant. Forget dipping on water, I just touched the leftearphone after washing my hands and lightly toweling my hands and it stopping working.Sounds is too low, unless you are 90% up in volume. You won't be able to hear anything.Noise cancellation is a joke.Better leave the product and buy something else.Post 8-10 meters you will hear sound in any one of the earphones.","This product was got in ₹1999 on Amazon Great Indian sale and its pathetic.

"I know my return window has exhausted, but would still like to add my review. I didn't like this product at all, won't recommend anyone to go for it. The pairing breaks in between for no reason and all of your time just gets wasted in resetting or pairing them again. I have hardly used 8-10 times since those have been received, but feel very upset on the quality that Boat has to offer.Apologies if the review hurt anyone, but utter wastage of money and effort.","I know my return window has exhausted, but would still like to add my review.

"Bought for ₹2,499/- there were several issues, primarily connectivity issues, battery issues, static issues etc. One of the airpods functions completely independent of the other, which is very annoying. The battery backup promised to last for at least 5 hours didn't last for more than 3 in actuality.The delivery was fine & on time though.I had purchased this product with very high hopes & really didn't wanna give up so requested a replacement which turned out to be worse than the first one. This clearly looked like a fake, cheap imitation of the original product. On connecting to my laptop, the airdopes produced the worst kind of sound. There were terrible connitivity issues. One of the airpods kept blinking & the other didn't ever stir. The battery backup wasn't great either. The case looked terribly brittle & in a precarious condition & position. The right airdope kept functioning independently of the left one which was really annoying.Completely frustrated, I spoke to Amazon for a replacement to which they denied & said that only a return was possible & it was really off putting since that meant a loss of discount received for me. Now I would have to pay approximately ₹250 to buy the same product (although I'm never gonna go that). The Amazon team kept repeating their unmeant & unfelt apologies & assured me that a technical team would contact me within 24 hours & a swift redressal of my issues would be effected. However nothing happened & I was ultimately forced to return it at a loss of 10%.The sound quality is not up to the mark, there is no noise cancellation whatsoever, active or passive, the airdopes hurt your earlobes & are prone to falling off, no matter how much they assure you otherwise. The bass quality isn't that great either, at higher volumes it gives you a headache.This product clearly looks like a cheap chinese knock off, I wouldn't recommend it to any sensible buyer.","Bought for ₹2,499/- there were several issues, primarily connectivity issues, battery issues, static issues etc. One of the airpods functions completely independent of the other, which is very annoying.

"I am writing this review after 3 weeks of extensive usage.Design: 4/5. It's small and eartips out of the box are comfortable. It fits perfectly in my ears. The big eartips had better passive noise cancellation. Although the small hooks provided really caused pain in my ears. Eventhough it's made of rubber, it didn't adjust properly or simply was not made for my ear. But it's removable so I bid goodbye to that ear hooks and now no pain at all.Sound quality: 4/5. It's fairly great. Bass is decent, treble and highs and lows arr balanced. No noticeable distortion at high volume too. But if you are a gamer and you need to hear footsteps to play, you will be disappointed with any other TWS at this price range, let alone this one. Because it has a significant amount of latency. So not recommended for gaming.Battery: 4/5. I listen my songs and watch videos all at 100% volume at all times. So at a stretch the earphones lasted me around 4 hours straight. And with the box, considering I use the earphones for approximately 4 to 5 hours a day, the charge in the case lasted me for an entire week until I had to recharge it again. It has almost become a routine that I have to charge it in every Mondays.Misc: 3.5/5. Considering sweat proof feature, it's fairly decent. It withstood my daily workouts and cardio. And the CTC is extremely sensitive. It responds to even minute accidental touches. And when I lie down, the accidental touch by the pillow causes it to pause my song. Although over a week of usage, I got used to it and so would you.And the connectivity is very good. You switch the Bluetooth on on your phone, and then open the box and it will get connected ( for the very 1st time of usage, you need to connect it manually) automatically. And the range is also decent. I leave my phone charging at one room and I wander around my house still it doesn't get disconnected.And there's one issue with the earphones. There is some kind of static noise in few apps. For me it happened while playing COC. It's low in volume but still noticeable, and at times annoying but I am used to it now. This issue and the fact that I had to remove the rubber earhooks to be comfortable are the only noticeable cons to this TWS to me.Conclusion: Overall a very good product. It's my first body product and tbh I am not disappointed. It's an all-rounder. Good sound quality, decent battery, good design. I don't know about other TWS at this range but according to me, for 2k it's pretty much worth the money.","I am writing this review after 3 weeks of extensive usage.Design: 4/5. It's small and eartips out of the box are comfortable. It fits perfectly in my ears. The big eartips had better passive noise cancellation. Although the small hooks provided really caused pain in my ears. Eventhough it's made of rubber, it didn't adjust properly or simply was not made for my ear. But it's removable so I bid goodbye to that ear hooks and now no pain at all.Sound quality: 4/5. It's fairly great. Bass is decent, treble and highs and lows arr balanced.

"I bought this TWS on monday and i am testing it alote. I was almost 1 week unit i am using them.1. From bass point of view, these TWS are  awesome.2.

The voice experience is very good in  songs.5. But at last to be very honest there is a  problem in connectivity.

"Although sound quality was good but definitely not worth the money because of disgusting service from boat. Airdopes stopped working after 3 months of usage then company took 2 months to replace it and even the replaced product was damaged. Again it's been nearly two months and I haven't received the second replacement, neither there's any update on the ticket from past 15 days. Totally I'm regretting every penny of price for choosing boat. I'm 1000% sure there are better deals than this in the same price range.Edit: I had to replace the product three times and everytime it was damaged replacement. Finally I gave up and i m using it anyways. Boat is clearly the worst.","Although sound quality was good but definitely not worth the money because of disgusting service from boat.

Sound Quality : This is the most important part which I did not like and that is the reason I gave 1 star. Because at this price I expected a better audio quality but I was disappointed & also I felt the voice is pretty low if I will compare with boat neck bands.That's it guy's.

Airdopes are good at a price range of Rs.:-2500 but not preferable beyond that.Few things I observed while using airdopes1. Don't have noise cancellation. Person speaking to you can easily here background noise which is very disturbing while talking to someone over the call.2. Battery backup is good. Airdopes works up-to 4.5 hours on single charge. Case charging capacity is good.3. Didn't find any latency while playing games. Good voice quality while playing audio or video.4. IWP is really good. Connects instantly once the case is open.5. Not preferable to using in open space for calling purpose.

"I ordered Boat Airdopes 441 on 15th July 2020. Within use of a month, one of the piece stopped charging, so I wrote a complaint with Boat.

On opening the packet I found that I have received the airdopes of Black colour, whereas the airdopes that I own are of Bumblebee colour. Now i don't know who's used airdopes Boat has sent me.

"I ordered them in the Amazon sale and got them for a very good price, sound is good, so is the bass. I mean for the prices it could have been the best buy in this segment but the battery for me was very very bad. It drained out from 100 to 50% in just 30 minutes of music usage on 70% volume. Not acceptable when the manufacturer claims 5 hours of backup. Also the left ear bud started heating up during the usage. Build quality and everything else is fine but the major selling point for this product is battery backup and if the buds cannot even have 3 hours of battery life on a single charge then no point in having a charging case providing 150 hours of backup.I returned them and got the refund pretty quickly, not worth the time and effort.","I ordered them in the Amazon sale and got them for a very good price, sound is good, so is the bass.

"Overall sound quality is above average. I think too much bass.Note: the Voice call quality is poor. I think the problem lies in the mic of the headset. The person on the other end of the call is complaining about the poor voice quality like echoing voice, or muffled voice. I've myself tried letting other person speak through it and found poor quality in call voice.My review: It's okay for entertainment purpose but not that good for calls. Okay for gaming( not that low latency but little lower than other tws headsets. A little delay in sound after the action can be seen).","Overall sound quality is above average.

"I bought these for 1999.Used the airdopes 441 for about 6 weeks now. These are worth for the price range. The sound quality is decent...good bass for those who prefer it. Touch controls works fine so far. The case is compact and of decent quality. The hinge however did get a bit wobbly in few weeks of use.Battery is more than sufficient for short to medium usage. Fitting seems fine for me. There is, though, some pain after long use(about 2-3 hours). (Rarely) There are times when there is a short glitch in the feed of either right, left or both buds.Other than these the product is good to use.If you are trying for earbuds, this is a good option in the price range.","I bought these for 1999.Used the airdopes 441 for about 6 weeks now.

Sound and bass quality is good. The product is last long after a full charge.

I have been using them for over 4 months. Sound quality is good and all. Main issue is sometimes devices cannot connect to them and then I have to just reset them by putting them back in the box and doing that 3-4 taps. Also sometimes only one ear piece connects and the other one doesn't. Again have to put them back into the box. This happens more often than you would expect.,I have been using them for over 4 months. Sound quality is good and all.

"The earbuds are great: sound quality is more or less good, battery life is good and connectivity is great as well.

"These airdrops 441 pro are good. But it's bass boosted that you will have to go to your eq available on your music player and make the eq flat and even cut the bass further. Otherwise the connectivity is great. Battery backup so far is good.The hardest part is these dopes are not very comfortable for the ears, the rubber pads that lock to ears will cause pain just after 1-2 mins of use. Folks at Boat have done a decent job otherwise, but these rubber supports are causing pain to the ears. Here In my case. Also the noise cancellation is not the best.","These airdrops 441 pro are good.

Felt cheated by Boat and Amazon.The main problem is hardware quality. Within 2 months of purchasing touch controls stopped working. I asked for replacement and they took 20 days for it. On top of that replacement is more faultier than original one. Left earpeice was giving hiss sound and right earpiece was disconnecting very frequently. Once again I asked for replacement but this time I visited service center and they have replaced it instantly.I think Boat is giving refurbished products to their customers.,Felt cheated by Boat and Amazon.The main problem is hardware quality.

"I was able to buy this product in 1700 which is an amazing price given the bass quality and good touch panel. The problem that no one is talking about is the static noise issue in the left earbud.

"Used it for 1 year on an average of 5-6 hours per day. Passive noice cancellation, bass is good. The sound was balanced even in 100% volume for some 3-4 months after purchase.

"I'm giving 1 star for the after sales service and the product quality. I bought the product on 13th June and within 2 months the left earpod is not getting charged in the charging case. I have bought 1 Bluetooth headset, 1 Bluetooth Speaker, 1 Bluetooth Earpod and 1 wired earphone from Boat and the only thing still working is the Bluetooth speaker maybe because I paid a hefty amount on that and as instructed in the Boat site to avail warranty I raised the ticket or request and uploaded the invoice downloaded from the Amazon site.  Later I received a mail stating that the invoice is not valid or clear. I have repeatedly sent the mail attaching the downloaded invoice copy from amazon site and still they haven't given a revert. They are not going to replace your product if it's faulty and they are the biggest thieves I have ever seen.

These eardopes are Good in sound quality. But they are too heavy and not comfortable. If you watching your phone while sitting or if you lie down on your bed then they will fall down eventually.

"I received it today i.e 28th July 2020 and with the 6 hours I used it out of the box, the battery dropped from 67% to 11%.I'm going to update this review after a full power cycle of the charge in the headphones.For it being the first day here's my feedback -Volume 3/5 - Could be better, a 5-6% lower volume than the JBL 205BT that I also haveAudio Spectrum 3/5 - The sound image is Bass heavy, there were instances where the bass overpowered and masked all other frequencies. Thumbs down for music consumption. It still is great for Movies, Shows and Games.Features 4/5 - The touch controls are sensitive and even a scrape of any part of your body might pause or change the track. Although I really wish there were volume controls for this. Volume needs to be adjusted manually from the paired device.Build 4/5 - Good build quality and stable fit in the ears. The point deducted is for the charging box lid which is just loose and cheap feeling when open.Overall for the first day of use I faced no pairing issues with the variety of devices I connected to and I'm waiting to review it further 3 months down the line.","I received it today i.e 28th July 2020 and with the 6 hours I used it out of the box, the battery dropped from 67% to 11%.I'm going to update this review after a full power cycle of the charge in the headphones.For it being the first day here's my feedback -Volume 3/5 - Could be better, a 5-6% lower volume than the JBL 205BT that I also haveAudio Spectrum 3/5 - The sound image is Bass heavy, there were instances where the bass overpowered and masked all other frequencies.

"Sound quality is fine. But the touch feature is quite of an inconvenience. Even if my hair touches the touch sensitive part, calls get cut or music gets paused . Apart from that the earpiece has fallen numerous times from my ear while I was using it, not that it isn't strong enough, but I almost lost one piece due to this issue. Charging capacity is fine.","Sound quality is fine. But the touch feature is quite of an inconvenience. Even if my hair touches the touch sensitive part, calls get cut or music gets paused .

"Decent product in affordable price.Sound quality is excellent.Good Noise cancellation.Fast pairing.Other person can't hear my voice properly on phone call.

"First thing that strikes about this product is the bass, its a lot. Though not considered desirable by audiophiles, as it subdues the nuances of mids and highs. But that does not disregard the sound it has to offer - Bass heavy but still pretty decent for the price point.Also the bass and noise cancellation depends on how snugly one fits it in the ear. Advisable not to fit too snug in the ear as it can lead to discomfort in the ear and also too high a bass.Though it fits fairly well without putting it too much inside, and wont fall off, even on a jog.Bought it for my cardio workouts, it serves the purpose - Never falls off and sounds decent.Pretty satisfied with the product.","First thing that strikes about this product is the bass, its a lot.

Earbuds are not in sync. When manual earbud switch off tried then only either of them get switched off and not together..same tried with factory reset but light blinks only on left one as required and not on right. So it look like both pieces are not in sync with each other. Calling quality is not so good...u really need to talk louder some times. Overall not a good experience..n as it's under replacement policy only....so be careful before buying this earbud.,Earbuds are not in sync.

I bought them on the day of their launch and they lasted me less than six months. This includes a replacement that took Boat 5 weeks to carry out. They're steeply priced for an average output. The service is time-consuming. Longetivity is a laugh. The only thing I can guarantee is that they won't fall out of your ears and that is really. Not reason enough to spend 2-grand on a device.,I bought them on the day of their launch and they lasted me less than six months. This includes a replacement that took Boat 5 weeks to carry out.

Got mine delivered today. The packaging was excellent.I'm not an expert in these areas but the bass sound is low which is what i preferred. Also its stays in your and doesn't drop off even when you're jumping since i go for jog and do jump rope i really needed an earbud with good support.

The sound is good. But the left earpod continuously drops.

I wanna give real review because everyone's money is precious like me.. If You want to listen only music then this product is good..But if you want to talks with calling then this is totally worst product... Your call reciver never can hear you clearly..I changed it 2 times(returns) but my problem was not solve.. Actually they have no any strong noise cancellation features.

"I just got this package today. First of all the delivery facility was really good. Even in this lockdown I received my package in 6 days outside the city. I've tested for sound, base quality. Both are great. Atleast at this range it is really awesome. The LEDs are so cool. With flashing green and blue lights. The touch control is quiet efficient and has a red LED for that. In pictures the case might seem big but it's so small and can fit in your pocket. I was worried at first about the calling facility. I've only tried that once. It was quiet good actually. There was no complaint for the person on the other side. It might not be as good outside. It has a good enough range to keep your phone at one place in a room. I've looked up about IPx7. It says this device will be okay being submerged under 3 feet or 1 m of water for 30 mins. *Don't try to test this. This is only to assure you that it can handle sudden rains and water splashes or sudden falling in water. So I think it's pretty good for the price we're paying. Again there is the case of noise cancellation. I'd say this one is pretty good in its work. I've been using boat products for 3 years now. I'm more than satisfied with the customer services by boat and the replacement facility. So if you want something like this just go for it. You'd be more than amazed...","I just got this package today. First of all the delivery facility was really good. Even in this lockdown I received my package in 6 days outside the city.

"I thought it would be a nice pair of earphones with good sound quality and battery life but was highly disappointed. I have already replaced these once but both times the product I recieved was faulty. One earphone would just switch off while the other still has about 80% of it's battery left. Never seen a worse manufacturing of a product, that too from a reputed company like boat. Waste of money as I can't use the earphones anymore with just one earphone that is working. And there is no way to replce it again. Don't buy it, it's not worth your money.","I thought it would be a nice pair of earphones with good sound quality and battery life but was highly disappointed.

"Given the price this is pretty awesome in every aspect. Battery life, fit, quality etc.My only complaint is in the noise cancellation.This doesn’t have active noise cancellation, what it does is when you wear it, due to the very tight fit in the ear it will cut you off from the surroundings which can turn out dangerous if you are on the road or something.On the other end the tight fit helps with the bass which is genuinely perfect.","Given the price this is pretty awesome in every aspect.

Worst in the case of calling functions (sound quality is very worst)..I guess it was designed for only hearing the songs through BT and it is not fit for these calling options. Because it often get disconnected while in call and the opposite person on the call couldnt hear what I speak (there were some sound/noise throughout the call) and quality was poor. Idk whether i have received defective quality or not but I didn't expect this from BOAT.

The sound quality is good. However the bass is not as good as it is expressed in the product description. Further I also expected to use it for answering calls. But this is where the product is most disappointing. The mic does not work as expected. Not only that there is a big difference in audio quality that one hears when using with or without mic. Can buy only if one wants to hear music.,The sound quality is good. However the bass is not as good as it is expressed in the product description.

Not only that there is a big difference in audio quality that one hears when using with or without mic.

"I used Earpiece and found that they are making pain in ear within 15-20 Minutes. They makes pressure on a side of Ear and causes Pain.

"Purchased it on first day of launch at 2.5k.Its very good TWS in its price range as it offers a beast battery life.Its design and build is normal & not that premium but it works flawlessly whether we talk about its sound, its connectivity and its grip on ears. It didn't feel that heavy on ears but the case is definitely a bit heavy because it has 2600 mAh battery which is really huge. Connecting it is very easy and set is also hassle free, just go through the manual once and one will understand all its settings. It has metal hosing which is definitely a very good thing to mention. It has type C charging which is very good in its segment. Overall its a very good product with very good specs. One thing worth mentioning that its made in China product.","Purchased it on first day of launch at 2.5k.Its very good TWS in its price range as it offers a beast battery life.Its design and build is normal & not that premium but it works flawlessly whether we talk about its sound, its connectivity and its grip on ears.

I am writing this review after using the product for more than 15 days. The battery does not last for more than 4 to 5 hours.Does not fit into ears falls down very often. And sound quality or noise reduction is not good at all. Sometimes it doesn't even connect to other device also.After 20 days of using it suddenly stopped working it not connected to any device.Overall I can say one of the worst buys I have done.
